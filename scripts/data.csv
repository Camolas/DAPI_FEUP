Cold Summer,Young Jeezy Presents USDA,2007,4.5,"The new record from Young Jeezy's group mostly does away with the sweeping production and the success-above-all exhortations of Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101 and The Inspiration.
","Young Jeezy isn't much of a rapper, at least as far as that term is traditionally understood. Instead, his appeal rests on three pillars: his overdriven Tony Robbins motivational-speaker rhetoric, his usually-multitracked slow-motion groan, and the churning, monolithic doom-rap production style pioneered by frequent collaborator Shawty Redd. Those three selling-points don't look like much on paper, but they were enough to make for two compulsively listenable albums. Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101 and The Inspiration both shifted more than a million copies in a period when albums aren't selling well at all, and they did it on the strength of the triumphantly larger-than-life persona that Jeezy's created for himself. When those three pillars come together right, Jeezy sounds enormous. Without them, he'd be nothing, and that's why you never hear him on tracks that don't match his singular aesthetic. But Cold Summer, the new album from Jeezy's group USDA, mostly does away with the sweeping production and the success-above-all exhortations. When Jeezy is alongside compatriots Slick Pulla and Bloodraw, he loses his emotional strive, instead bullshitting about the day-to-day minutia of drug-dealing. And the production mostly comes from relatively anonymous and untested unknowns, all doing their best to approximate Shawty Redd's titanic lurch and only occasionally succeeding. As for Jeezy's voice, it takes up a whole lot less space, leaving room for his less distinctive friends. And still Def Jam released Cold Summer, and it debuted in Billboard's top five, selling nearly 100,000 copies in its first week. Young Jeezy is good at what he does.

Cold Summer* is just the latest in a near-endless string of entourage albums. Whenever a rapper finds success these days, it seems inevitable that he'll eventually scoop up a bunch of hometown buddies and throw them all on an album. Every once in a while, these albums will exploit the hell out of a couple of powerful new voices and build on the established star's appeal; Tha Dogg Pound's Dogg Food immediately springs to mind. More often, though, these albums come off as quickie cash-grabs, diluting their stars' talents and letting a bunch of lesser talents waste everybody's time; consider, if you will, the St. Lunatics' Free City. Cold Summer mostly fits into the latter category; Slick Pulla and Bloodraw lack Jeezy's worldbeating charisma, and Jeezy more often than not descends to their level over the course of the album. Legend has it that Slick Pulla is the guy who first convinced Jeezy to rap, but his husky, punchline-heavy style never makes much of an impression. Pulla had a scene-stealing verse on the original version of Jeezy's ""Trap or Die"": ""Don't talk to square niggas, you know, Spongebobs/ Kanye West niggas, talkin' through the wire, dog."" On Cold Summer, though, his most quotable line is this: ""The shields in this bitch; we seek and destroy/ Your boy got a mind like Sigmund Freud."" That's just not going to cut it. As for Bloodraw, his singsong wheeze blurs into the background more often than not. Bloodraw and Pulla aren't terrible or anything, but they both share space with a genuine star, and both sound workmanlike and indistinct in comparison. As for Jeezy, his sense of purpose only rarely surfaces; for the most part, he's content to kick banalities alongside his friends.

The album has a few bright spots. The regal horns of opener ""Focus"" animate the song's trap-rap cliches. ""Check"" boasts disorienting waves of swarming synths and a Bloodraw chorus that actually works. ""Live My Life"", with its shimmering acoustic guitars and its warm, slow glide of a chorus from Outkast-affiliated crooner Scar, is genuinely pretty. But most of the tracks here sound chintzy and samey, their bargain-basement beats melting into a tedious lump and bottoming out with a remarkably unseductive troika of sex-songs at the middle of the album. We've been hearing a lot of these entourage albums lately, but most of them have been coming out on Koch, an indie-label apparently willing to release music from the crews of B-list rappers like Slim Thug and B.G. I can't for the life of me figure out why Def Jam, still the most important rap label in existence, would take a flier on the two jokers who stand next to Jeezy onstage, and maybe it's telling that the resulting record sounds for all the world like a Koch product. The single best moment on Cold Summer comes at the end of the album: the remix of The Inspiration single ""Go Getta"", which features strong and memorable guest appearances from Bun B and Jadakiss. Slick Pulla and Bloodraw, appropriately enough, are nowhere to be found.

Yes Lawd! Remixes,NxWorries,2017,7.4,"On this collection of remixes from Anderson .Paak and Knxwledge’s 2016 LP, the latter artist flexes his mastery at deconstructing beats and samples—occasionally transforming the mood of a track.
","When Anderson .Paak and Knxwledge dropped Yes Lawd! on Stones Throw at the end of 2016, they entered the label’s lineage of underground superduos like Jaylib and Madvillain, pairing a vocalist and a producer with complementary styles, with shared ancestors on their musical family tree. They largely lived up to the tradition, lacing what would otherwise be a classic tape from the L.A. Beat Scene with .Paak’s soulful R&B vibe. Each artist stepped slightly outside his comfort zone, and in the process, proved that together they really do have the range.
For Yes Lawd! Remixes, .Paak’s vocals are recycled from the original LP, making this collection all about Knxwledge flexing his mastery at deconstructing beats and samples. That they’re his beats to begin with does nothing to diminish his technical prowess. The producer has an uncanny understanding of the function and importance of each instrument, expertly wielding them for effect. He doesn’t have to change much to completely alter the vibe. On “Alltypeofchnces,” he swaps out crunchy static for clean pickwork from an electric guitar; on the “Wngs (Remix),” the track is completely transformed by swapping the drum kit for a dominant percussive bassline. The macabre strings on “Lyk Dis (Remix)” transform its mood from a sexy bedroom jam to something more depressive.
Projects like this seem to flow from Knxwledge like water—his Bandcamp page currently offers a staggering 84 albums for sale—and he somehow manages to improve a number of the tracks on this already stellar LP. The original “Suede” impersonated the warm tones of Brian Jackson’s Fender Rhodes, which the remix abandons in favor of airy atmospherics worthy of a Sade record. “Best One” was already lovely, with a smooth organ melody, but the remix manages to be both crunchier and more lush, as the organ takes a backseat to somber strings and what sounds like a vibraphone. It’s gorgeous, and makes the additional “Chppd” version seem superfluous.
By its very nature, the Yes Lawd! Remixes were always going to be less consistent than the originals. Knxwledge is essentially disassembling a completed puzzle and re-fitting the pieces back together, occasionally to its detriment. The “Kutless” remix sounds completely Xan’d out, all the energy drained from the original, and the new version of “H.A.N.” has a distracting warble that doesn’t add much to what was Yes Lawd!’s standout track. If nothing else, though, these remixes offer a compelling glimpse into the mind of one of the game’s most talented beat architects, a sample artist freaking his own samples. He doesn’t always stick the landing, but the moments in which he does make it worth the effort.

Yellow,Naomi Punk,2017,5.6,"Olympia punk trio Naomi Punk’s third album is a 75-minute, 25-track study in repetition. They’ve become more interested in deconstructing their songs than writing them.
","The third album from Olympia punk trio Naomi Punk, Yellow, opens with a sequence of three instrumental tracks that wander and then stop cold, like dropped thoughts. With them, Yellow wastes no time weeding out listeners hoping for another quick fix of grungy rock. In every other regard, though, Yellow wastes quite a bit of time. Years in the making, it is a 75-minute, 25-track study in repetition that doesn’t readily let the listener in on whatever conclusions it draws.
Naomi Punk had hinted they might have a record like this in them. The 2014 Television Man LP periodically broke from the shiv-like rock of their debut for lengthy, arty explorations. But where Television Man was still a rock album at its core, Yellow’s driving impulse is experimentation. In the spirit of Wire, they’ve grown more interested in deconstructing their songs than writing them. And, as if in homage to that group, guitarist Travis Coster’s voice takes on shades of both Colin Newman’s punk sneer and Graham Lewis’ dehumanized croon. One of Naomi Punk’s cooler tricks is nailing the way that Lewis’ more robotic lead turns always sounded like they were being played back from a computer running out of RAM.
There are a couple of spirited 1980s nods along the way. With its synthesized bass, one of the only hints of bass on the whole album, “My Shadow” nails the whole Karate Kid-era video arcade aesthetic, while for two minutes “Matroska” conjures the barren, synthesized rumble of the Cure’s Faith. But those sonic switch-ups are few and far between. Most of the album’s main event songs, the ones that aren’t scrapped together from found sounds or studio racket, follow the same general template of crooked guitar chords, strummed so repeatedly that your own hand can’t help but vicariously cramp up, while drums thud and indeterminate noises creak and bubble around them.
It’s a template as rigid as Andy Warhol’s soup can screenprints, and like those works, Yellow’s songs keep coming long after the point has been made. Instead of paying off with new twists or revelations, the album only grows more cemented in its ways as it enters its increasingly redundant final stretch. The 11-minute gauntlet of “Yellow Cone Hat,” “Carniceria,” and “Motorcade” plays out as three very minor variations of the same mechanical riff, none of them any more eventful or memorable than the others. All that repetition makes for an album that’s as monochromatic as its title.
The central challenge of art punk is how to experiment without completely sacrificing the thrill of a sound that’s typically been synonymous with speed and brevity. Naomi Punk aren’t interested in solving that problem, though. Their concerns are largely conceptual. Between its purposefully narrow sonic template, recirculated motifs, and disjointed lyrics about art and actualization, Yellow presents itself as an intricate puzzle box, one that probably reveals even more facets on vinyl, where its songs are spread out across four sides, creating new patterns to ponder. Naomi Punk have clearly put a lot of thought into constructing it. Now if only it were more interesting to engage with.

The Feeling,Naomi Punk,2012,7.6,"Naomi Punk's proper debut, originally released on vinyl and now being issued by Captured Tracks digitally and on CD, captures the Olympia, Wash., trio studying the grunge rulebook just to tear it in half.
","Olympia/Seattle's Naomi Punk are at least partly inspired by their grunge forbearers. The genre's basic elements are well-represented: The sludgy erosion over the guitars, the drums blasting with machine-grade heaviness. Since the old formula goes ""one part metal, two parts punk, and one part psychedelic weird shit,"" it's not a stretch by any means to consider Naomi Punk a grunge band. And while they're clearly a part of a long lineage of bands taking their influence from the Seattle rock scene of the early 1990s, Naomi Punk's songs are not cheaply manufactured recreations of Soundgarden or even TAD.
The Feeling, originally released on vinyl and now being issued by Captured Tracks digitally and on CD, captures the trio studying the grunge rulebook just to tear it in half. Naomi Punk's approach to grunge is one of deconstruction and rebuilding in different places with fewer parts. Most of the album's songs change tempos at the drop of flannel, breaking into a dense wall of meticulously controlled chaos. Guitars are not delivered with a steady stream of chords; they come in blasts along with the crash cymbal, often at irregular points in the song. There's almost a need to keep up with them rhythmically over the first few listens, because the phrasing of the chords and beats zig zag through a motley course, unintentionally using empty space as every bit the weapon their guitars and drums are.
Despite the grunge signifiers, Naomi Punk seem to be working under a template like slowcore, art-punk, or no wave played at half-speed. They've given themselves a narrow palette to work with in this sense, but The Feeling's funeral-march tempos and unrelenting heaviness don't detract from what makes the album compelling. Aside from three quasi-classical guitar interludes, the record comes packed top-to-bottom with total bruisers, and for most of its 35 minutes, the music is hitting you with pummeling force, every bit as visceral as your favorite punk album from this year. Most of the songs come with a cathartic breakdown of some sort, whether it's the rollicking finish of ""Trashworld"" or the chorus of ""Burned Body"".
Not only does The Feeling connect on a purely visceral level, it's got plenty of emotional resolve. For a band whose poppiest song's titled ""Burned Body"" and for all of the lyrics about charred flesh and self-immolation, Naomi Punk are good at injecting a bit of hope and optimism into their music. ""I am the sun/ I am the shooting star"" goes the opening lyric of ""The Spell"".
The title track takes that optimism and shoots it into anthemic territory. Playing out like the battle scene climax of your favorite war movie, ""The Feeling"" starts out scaling back to hold the tension, but rolls into explosion after explosion. The chorus, the sedate tease of the middle eight, and then the climax-- ""And now I know that I can find a way""-- triumphantly rise above the din. Monolithic and seemingly impenetrable at first, The Feeling has a number of these moments, subtler details that offer plenty of rewards for whoever can stand being pummeled for almost 40 minutes.

Television Man,Naomi Punk,2014,7.9,"Pacific Northwestern punks Naomi Punk's second LP is a tough, grimy album made by three young men who sound like they could use more ""outside time"" in their lives. This is a band with a narrow idea of what it wants to do and a firm confidence in doing it.
","Television Man is a tough, grimy album made by three young men who sound like they could use more ""outside time"" in their lives. Its province is the damp basement, the dirty aquarium, dreamy half-places of strange light and no easy egress. No surprise that Naomi Punk are from the Pacific Northwest, a region legendarily devoid of sun but graced with persistent, almost prehistoric lushness—somewhere that feels both forbidding and overgrown at the same time.
This is a band with a narrow idea of what it wants to do and a firm confidence in doing it. Most of Television's songs—and most the songs on 2012's The Feeling, for that matter—are slow and grunge-like, anchored by vaguely radioactive-sounding guitars and vocals mumbled to the point of unintelligibility. They are heavy and romantic but sour end-to-end, the ballads of a teenage swamp thing preening in the dark.
They're also unexpectedly pretty, filled with twists of melody and structure far more sophisticated than they need to be to fly in the realms of punk and underground rock. Even on my fourth and fifth listen, I couldn't see all the way to the end of ""Television Man"" or ""Linoleum Tryst #19"", which have the psychedelic quality of a yawn that peels open to yet some improbably bigger yawn, stretching for a resolution always just out of reach.
In that respect, one obvious touchstone is Nirvana, who among other feats wrote noisy, guitar-based rock songs around chord changes so beautiful and labyrinthine that on first listen they somehow seem wrong. (If you haven't listened to ""Lithium"" in the past year, treat yourself.) At root, this is basic but deceptively simple stuff about the way two chords can sit next to each other like two familiar flavors paired in some revelatory way. The wit is not in the ingredients, per se, but in the contrast between them.
My introduction to Naomi Punk was through Parquet Courts' 2013 mixtape, which has continued to serve as a reliable map of underground bands marrying the simplicity and aggression of punk with the opacity of ""art,"" by which I generally mean ""things that aren't obvious."" Television isn't an album I listen to all the time—I value a positive outlook on life—but when I do listen to it, I savor it by the minute. Its style is limited, but the band manages to spread out within it, discovering their own idiosyncratic little vocabulary without ever exhausting it. And at bottom, that's what I find so attractive about the album: Despite its dimness and introversion, it always suggests a horizon.

It's Blitz!,Yeah Yeah Yeahs,2009,8.1,"YYYs make the dreaded ""mature album"" work by taking familiar shapes and tools and recombining them in ways that are bracing and unexpected.
","The cover of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' debut LP, 2003's Fever to Tell, set an early-decade benchmark for sheer ugliness, a deliberately heinous splatter of webbed blood, stabbed snakes, and flaming heads. The music was also confrontational, with lead singer Karen O following in the footsteps of countless riot grrls and righteous rock queens in crafting a persona of raw defiance and sexual menace.
Fast-forward six years, and a glance at the instantly iconic cover of the band's third full-length, It's Blitz!, tells you all you need to know about how far the Yeah Yeah Yeahs have come, from Fever to Tell through the middle-ground growing pains of 2006's Show Your Bones and up to today. A clean, simple image of a woman's hand bursting an egg-- it's no less powerful an indication of feminine strength and defiance than Fever's abrasive scrawl, yet it's miles and miles more subversive. It's also a fitting symbol for its music, taking familiar shapes and tools and recombining them in ways that are bracing and unexpected.
It's Blitz! is constructed from parts that by themselves aren't extraordinary-- in fact, many of them are quite banal, like the generic Franz-Bloc-Killers modern rock riff that propels ""Dull Life"" or the doomy one that drives ""Shame and Fortune"", sounding ripped straight off a late-period Smashing Pumpkins record. Much has been made of the album's heavy reliance on rock's eternal bugaboo, the synth, but often the synths are doing rock things rather than dance things, like on the buzzing, road-burning opener ""Zero"". Only two songs, ""Heads Will Roll"" and ""Dragon Queen"", deliver real disco backbeats.
With these unremarkable tools, however, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs still create great, compelling pop-rock, largely because of the way the songs themselves are organized, with conventional verse-chorus structures repeatedly eschewed in favor of detours, miniature grooves, and lengthy asides that produce the sensation of a band and a singer impulsively following their own emotional whims. Take the lovely, insinuating ""Soft Shock"", for instance-- it starts with tinkly keyboards and an Far East-sounding melody that builds to a refrain utilizing the words in the song's title, but it isn't the song's emotional climax, which is hidden until later, when Karen worriedly intones ""what's the time, what's the day, gonna leave me?"" Even more compositionally jarring are the slow, stretched-out set showcases ""Skeletons"" and ""Runaway"", the former taking a blippy little electro-ballad and then plopping martial drums and a melody that sounds taken from some Scottish battle hymn smack dab in the middle. In keeping with the arty tendencies that have blossomed within the band from the beginning, these songs often feel portioned out into passages or movements as opposed to flowing organically throughout.
With such an absence of easy signposts, we're especially apt to follow Karen wherever she goes, since she's our only hope for a guide. Yet she refuses to be a locus of explanation or control, keeping her lyrics generally vague and frequently losing herself in bursts of incomprehensible excitement or fervor. These fits and embellishments account for most of the best moments on the album-- the way she breathlessly pants ""crying, crying, crying"" on ""Zero"", or giddily draws out the last syllable of the line ""a hundred years old"" on ""Dull Life"", or how ""Heads Will Roll"" and ""Dragon Queen"" periodically dissipate into an inchoate softness.
The ninth song on Fever to Tell was ""Maps"", a fleeting glimpse of vulnerability on an album of gleeful scorn. On It's Blitz! that slot is occupied by ""Hysteric"", a song every bit as emotionally naked and immediately indelible as ""Maps"". Here though, it represents an island of piercing clarity and happy convention in a sea of bewilderment, impulse, and ecstasy.

Is Is EP,Yeah Yeah Yeahs,2007,8.2,"This EP collects newly recorded songs written in 2004 between the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' 2003 debut Fever to Tell and their 2006 follow-up, Show Your Bones, and as such is more reminiscent of the raw danger of the group's debut than its patient follow-up.
","Karen O has a curious range. She possesses a low, clear, expressive voice that communicates tender-hearted vulnerability easily and evocatively. But she also effortlessly reaches upper registers of grotesquerie, brazenly barking and blasting wordless sounds at her audience. It's easy to take this range for granted or simply to disregard it as another element in O's high-fashion stage show, but it's a critical factor of her performance and identity. One style is tender and pretty, the other ugly and visceral. They're often considered the flipsides of the same complicated woman, but more likely they arise from the same confessional impulse: On ""Maps"", ""Cheated Hearts"", and ""Turn Into"" (the best songs she's written), she exposes her fears, needs, and insecurities in a straightforward and fairly conventional way, but on ""Black Tongue"", ""Art Star"", and ""Tick"", she turns herself inside out for her audience, showing her bones as well as her blood, guts, and organs.
O tends towards the latter-- in concentrated form-- on Is Is, an EP collecting newly recorded songs written in 2004 between their 2003 debut Fever to Tell and their 2006 follow-up, Show Your Bones. With its martial beat and start-stop momentum, opener ""Rockers to Swallow"" is full of empty, threatening spaces, which O half-fills with barked commands that sound alternately like Ozzy on ""Crazy Train"" and a maniacal drill sergeant. Nick Zinner and Brian Chase-- who have just as much range as their bandmate-- sound like they're playing against each other. It's a shoot-out, with the audience caught in the crossfire.
In fact, there's barely a song there. ""Rockers to Swallow"" is all performance. This is what they do best. Their self-titled debut and the follow-up Fever to Tell sounded like the band had cobbled the songs together from frayed scraps found in skuzzy alleyways, bars, dives, cheap walk-ups, and vacant lots-- in other words, from real experiences in New York-- which made them a compelling alternative to their club-bound peers. In contrast to Fever, Show Your Bones felt written, as if O deliberately sat down to put her feelings onto paper and the band booked studio time to turn those scribblings into songs.
Produced by Australian Nick Launay (who recorded Gang of Four, Killing Joke, and Public Image Ltd), Is Is stands somewhere between the two albums: It never feels as fully lived-in as Fever, but sounds looser and more off-the-cuff than Bones. Like ""Rockers to Swallow"", the title track is an elaboration of grunts and riffs, with O growling to the rafters in other buildings and Zinner's aggressive guitar spiraling psychedelically around Chase's high-hat-riding beat. But the remaining three tracks are songs in a more traditional sense-- and good ones at that. ""Kiss Kiss"" achieves a throbbing forward motion, with Zinner's guitar churning a bass riff that propels O's tense, terse vocal melodies and sexually conflicted lyrics.
Even when she's singing, she still punctuates her words with an arsenal of onomatopoeia: the girlish ah-ahs on ""10x10"" contrasting the wounded, nearly spoken intro; the yowls that precede the chorus on ""Down Boy""; the throat-scraping growl on the title track. Each aspect of her stage identity finds equal expression on these songs, which only makes them sound more immediate and affecting. In fact, Is Is may be their most instantly accessible release, which is not a critical dig but just a way of saying it finds a good balance between alienating and inviting, between song and performance. This dynamic could sustain an entire album, but the EP's brevity is the key to its appeal: the Yeah Yeah Yeahs know enough to leave you wanting more.

Fever to Tell,Yeah Yeah Yeahs,2003,7.4,"Can a band build an entire career, a legacy even, on a handful of EPs and a boundless torrent of ...
","Can a band build an entire career, a legacy even, on a handful of EPs and a boundless torrent of press? How many party dresses need to take a beer bath before the Yeah Yeah Yeahs drop the rock icon pastiche and just play some music? Over and over again, they've been accused of empty posturing, wallowing in scrofulous, self-conscious ""irony,"" disguising themselves Predator-style as the public conception of who they were supposed to be rather than who they actually are. And yet (dramatic pause), until the stylists and spin-mongers start writing the music, why does this still have to matter? The band plays the blistering, bassless hand they're dealt, plus or minus the cards up their designer sleeves, and make the ""right moves."" More power to them; hype, famously, is a bitch, a shrew, and in the end, it's still theirs to try and tame. No one wants to be the ill-fated morning-after tat on the ass-end of the garage-rock revival, after all.
The really stupid part of all this, though, is that the shitstorm of publicity that's been hanging overhead the Yeah Yeah Yeahs is based on all of, what, eight songs? Two EP/singles? Robert Pollard throws away eight songs before breakfast and you sure as hell don't see him on the cover of NME. Well, hold yr breath, kids. The YYY's have finally released the plot element that their garage-to-riches Cinderella II story has most sorely lacked: The Full-Length Album. This is gonna make 'em rockstars, everybody! The final story arc-- and how's this for irony-- will conclude with them shedding their personas here, showing everyone that they've got what it takes to endure, and living happily ever after as the saviors of rock 'n' rollllll...
Except, they don't do any of that. Or maybe (and this is only an hypothesis) they were never all that guilty of the heinous crimes of Fashion they've been charged with in the first place? Either way, here it is, Fever to Tell, and they just play the same guitar/drums rock they have since the beginning-- what'd you expect? Sure, you can practically feel Karen O looking over her shoulder for approval with every faux-erotic squeal or disdainful shout, and a number of these tracks fall flat entirely because of the knowing, brutal swagger they try so damn hard to affect. And when it's all over, the slow-burning, gently chaotic dissolve of ""No No No"" (even the title is self-conscious) or the bluesy strut of ""Black Tongue"" will wither under anything more than passing scrutiny, but more will remain.
Reason is, first and foremost, the near-faultless musical support at the core of the YYY's: Nick Zinner and Brian Chase. If you can hear (or even care to try to hear, which you shouldn't) an ounce of ""posture"" in Zinner's thunderous guitar licks or Chase's relentless percussive assault, then you're a more cynical man (or woman) than I. The rhythms are never very complicated, but when it counts, Chase pounds away with enough precise desperation to project an unfailing sense of urgency; it carries through even the more emotional tracks, lending the rare vulnerability a tragic sort of transience.
Between the vicious buzz and slender trill of Zinner's strings is a breathtaking range-- the robotically looped harmonics of ""Rich"" coupled with the layered crunch of the wall-of-sound that collapses on top of them; the stop/start emergency-room shriek of ""Date With a Night"". Even Karen O seems stunned by the anthemic scope of the blazing, surf-like guitar and Chase's deafening percussion on ""Y Control""; she turns in one of her most subdued vocals, as if it's all she can do just to keep up. Not coincidentally, it's also one of her most impressive turns.
That's not O's only compelling performance, though-- there are a couple moments when she drops her lacquered sneers and teases, and when this happens, it suddenly becomes very difficult to avoid seeing the music in a different light. Of course, her success varies. At times, she's the linchpin of the band-- and not just because her gratuitous sexual tension has become their trademark-- while at others she's the weakest link. The problem here is that, while the guys are definitely on here, they're still nowhere near groundbreaking, and as a result, they rise and fall depending largely on Karen's delivery. Her play-acting is what got the Yeah Yeah Yeahs slapped with the charges of shallow insincerity in the first place. It shouldn't matter if it's a façade, but it does; knowing beforehand what you're dealing with or not, it becomes very trying to accept every sleazy squeak as part of her routine. If the band ever wants to really dump these lingering doubts for good, they'll need to overcome this obstacle.
Still, for proof that the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, at their core, make a better band than they do runway trendsetters, one need look no further than Fever to Tell's singular true moment of clarity-- a tune of such moving grace I can scarcely believe they're responsible for it-- ""Maps"". Though the song is sadly in a class by itself on this record (it would take about two seconds to call roll for the tunes that even come close), absolutely everything falls into place here. The drums are gentle enough to simply caress the tune, but still pressing enough to make it clear that this second of happiness is fleeting, and Zinner's guitar work is easily his best to date, equal parts joy and discord. But it's Karen's vocals that steal the show; for once, they fairly drip genuine, regretful emotion: When she sings, ""Lay off/ Don't stray/ My kind is your kind/ I'll stay the same.../ They don't love you like I love you,"" almost on the verge of defeated tears, the emotive response it produces is very real, and that means a lot.

iTunes Originals,Yeah Yeah Yeahs,2009,7.0,"This iTunes collection spans YYYs' whole career, and it shows a band willing to adapt and change without regrets or nostalgia for its past.
","In 2000, Karen O, a Tisch transfer student, was as self-assured as any newly-minted New Yorker. So she and guitarist Nick Zinner thought of a band name and a logo before they had written any songs, as they reveal on one of this album's interview tracks. After they'd written some (very good) songs, their reputations-- Nick Zinner's cool, Karen O's beer-soaked bravado-- still preceded their records. But then YYYs released ""Maps"". Then they became less fashionable but no less good. And they matured, even before Karen O did the most New York thing of all: move to L.A.
This iTunes collection spans from their first EP to Its Blitz!, and it shows a band willing to adapt and change without regrets or nostalgia for its past. That YYYs are ready to have a greatest hits album pangs their older fans more than the band themselves. They don't hate getting older, or ever being that young.
That's most apparent from their choices and interviews here, beginning with an acoustic version of their debut EP's ""Our Time"". Abrupt and bluesy, clunky and amateur, it's also got a swagger that none of their subsequent songs matches-- not that the band wants them to. By their debut LP, YYYs were already a different band. ""I was feeling a little bit more aversion to the more rockish, noisy, kinda histrionic vocals, because I wasn't relating to it as a 27-year-old or 26-year-old as well as I did when I was 21 or 22,"" Karen O explained to Pitchfork in an interview. ""And I felt like the angst fizzled out when we were writing this album, and it was more kinda like a brewing sort of... I don't know what it was."" So ""Our Time""'s makeover is YYYs' makeover.
Three of the five acoustic versions are from It's Blitz: ""Runaway"", which Karen describes as ""epic"" in one of the iTunes interviews, melts into a torch song, while ""Hysteric"" takes on a spacious, ponderous quality that its spare melody barely supports. Breaking from the cliché of the solemn acoustic version, It's Blitz!'s ""Dull Life"" becomes an even better stomper, one that, as Karen O says in her interview still has ""that YYYs energy.""
The interview portions are far too short, and even shorter than you think, since the band hem when explaining their songs. Karen O ends her answers in a trailing, adolescent ""so...."" But what's fascinating is their phrase ""that YYYs energy."" This attitude is exactly what's kept them sane, and kept them good. Since YYYs define themselves not in terms of a particular sound or instrumentation, but rather ""energies,"" the supposed leaps they've made-- from sweaty punk band to doe-eyed balladeers to electronic pied pipers-- really seem like iterations of the same band, different outfits on the same body.
This may be what they mean when they hope to be, ""bigger than the sound,"" as Karen O sings on their rousing ""Cheated Hearts"" (here in its original form). Other songs (""Y Control"", ""Gold Lion"", ""Down Boy"", ""Heads Will Roll"") appear in their original versions. Their best song here and everywhere else, is still ""Maps"", a song that's come to stand for YYYs in a way that transcends even a ""signature song""--more than a hit, it's bound to the band DNA. They back up Zinner's acoustic guitar with violins as they did for their Radio City Music Hall gig. Writing it was, as Karen O says, ""a moment in time for us.""
A ""moment in time"" for them, for their fans. But this collection includes YYYs singles too familiar to be worth re-purchasing. As Tom Breihan said, all the acoustic versions can be purchased separately via iTunes for $5.25. When you price music by the song, you start to think cost per track; and in this case the product only justifies the price if this is your first YYYs album. Ever.
That said, the interviews are worth it, though the band can't talk about themselves for any length. You really do have to marvel at Karen O, though. In her 2005 interview with The Believer, she said, ""I'm fully putting myself out there for the people and for the sake of trying to lure them into the experience and out of... detachment."" It's the sort of platitude you expect from a front woman of Karen O's consummate skill and charisma, and yet it's her sheer ability as a communicator and perpetual optimist that is the real source of YYYs ""energy.""

Mosquito,Yeah Yeah Yeahs,2013,6.0,"For the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' fourth album, they returned to the casual creative processes that produced their first demo and electrifying debut album, yet they struggle to recapture their early vitality.
","There's a refrain you often hear about bands running on the sort of quick-burning demon energy that the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were channeling in the early part of the last decade: You had to be there. But on rare occasions, a band will make a record so thick with atmosphere that ""being there"" is just a matter of pushing play. Yeah Yeah Yeahs' 2003 debut, Fever to Tell, is one of those achievements: Even if you didn't make it to one of the infamous early New York shows and have the pleasure of getting your glasses sprinkled with the beery spit of a grinning, lipstick-smeared frontwoman in tattered Christian Joy, the record itself did a commendable job of bottling that experience. It was a debut that aced music's classic chemistry lesson: Combine a few unlikely, molten compounds, take a step back, and wait for the bang.
When they put out their second album, it seemed, at least at the time, like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were growing up too fast. Show Your Bones favored songcraft over shambolic energy, and sounded disappointingly tame on the heels of Fever's maniacal night-sweats. (It was also the beginning of a creative schism in the band; as Zinner told Spin in 2006, ""I didn't want to write and record in a studio... I just wanted to do demos on a four-track in somebody's apartment."" He lost that argument.) But in the long run, Bones has aged remarkably well, and now feels like a pivotal moment in the band's arc, setting the tone for a career of evolution, reinvention, and constant forward motion; 2009’s excellent It's Blitz! was a record of glammy, neo-Blondie avant-pop, staying true to their quirks but successfully expanding their range.
Mosquito, the group's fourth record, is its first step backwards. It feels uncharacteristic, calling to mind a lot of words that have never fit this band before: confused, dreary, uninspired, and-- on one particularly baffling song about aliens-- uncool. Karen may have bleached her hair electric blonde and donned some inspired, tinselly Elvis suits, but for once the band hasn't applied a similarly gleeful spirit of reinvention to its sound. Instead, Mosquito aims for more of a back-to-basics approach. ""We have this shitty little downtown studio [in New York] that belongs to us,"" Karen said in a recent Pitchfork interview, ""so we wrote songs and recorded demos whenever we felt inspired; it was kind of like Fever to Tell and our first demo."" But the often limp Mosquito lacks their earlier material's spark.
Mosquito is not without highlights, but it requires some patience to unearth them, because when this record is bad, it's loudly, brazenly bad. ""Area 52"" is probably the lowest point in the band's catalog; its lyrics have a Spinal Tap syntax (""Message came from outer space/ Future of the human race"") that makes it play like self-parody. The song also features an uncharacteristically wooden vocal from Karen, who's eventually drowned out by a wash of spacey blips and bleeps. At least she sounds like she's having a little more fun with ""Mosquito"", but even her trademark charisma can't inject a sting into the weak chorus (""They'll suck your blood! They'll suck your blood!"" she tries, over and over). It's surprising how off the mark these songs sound coming from a band who used to be able to do goofy well. The upbeat songs on Fever careened with a wobbly, inebriated energy, but whenever Mosquito aims for ""zany"" or ""light,"" it teeters around like an exhibitionist ""drunk"" on non-alcoholic beer.
""Mosquito"" should have been a B-side at best, but the fact that it's the title track-- and the inspiration for the garish, David-Cronenberg-vomiting-on-a-Garbage-Pail-Kids-card cover art-- makes it that much harder to ignore. That a thin, overly literal song like ""Mosquito"" is at the center of the artistic statement they're trying to make only makes this album more of a head-scratcher. Whatever's holding this collection of songs together never quite congeals-- a problem exemplified by the James Murphy-produced ""Buried Alive"", a moody, nocturnal groove interrupted halfway through by a verse from Dr. Octagon (the high-concept, time-traveling alien persona of avant-rap legend Kool Keith) that lands in the song with a heavy thud.
On repeated listens, though, a few diamonds emerge in the rough. Built around Zinner's expectant single-note riff, the gradual crescendo of ""Despair"" plays like a more muted take on Show Your Bones' best single, ""Cheated Hearts"", though its refrain is even more poignant. ""Oh despair, you've always been there,"" Karen sings with the perfect combination of exhaustion and defiance, ""You were there through my wasted years... there through my wasted life."" The closing track, ""Wedding Song"" (which Karen sang to her husband Barney Clay at their 2011 wedding reception) sounds a bit like a happy-ending sequel to ""Maps"", brooding with a similar emotional intensity (""In flames I sleep soundly/ With angels around me""). But the most promising-- and perhaps only truly new-- avenue the band wanders down on Mosquito is ""Subway"", a subtle, evocative sound collage driven by Karen's falsetto and the percussive churn of a train on the track. It's heavy on conceptual follow-through and finely crafted atmosphere on a record where both are in short supply.
On their best and most smartly sequenced albums, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs create a sense that their bratty swagger and disarming vulnerability were emanating from the same power source. In the wake of Fever's amped-up ""Date With the Night"" or ""Tick"", ""Maps"" feels like an inevitable come-down, but the songs on Mosquito don't feed off each other in the same way. The album's most keyed-up moment comes early, in the solid lead-off single ""Sacrilege"", but when a gospel choir storms the song's closing coda it feels unprompted-- this is a band that used to be able to kindle the same kind of fire from the minimal components of its own chemistry. Still, even if Mosquito suggests otherwise, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' much-lauded SXSW showing and recent homecoming performances in New York prove that magic can still happen for them on stage. Maybe now you just have to be there.

Pin EP,Yeah Yeah Yeahs,2003,6.8,"For all the faults and imperfections that continue to show up in the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' body of work (repetitive ...
","For all the faults and imperfections that continue to show up in the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' body of work (repetitive arrangements in Nick Zinner's less-inspired moments, Karen's play-acting testing the limits of endurance), the results are staggering when they bring the full weight of their collective abilities to bear. Between Zinner's cutting drones, Chase's lurking rhythms, and Karen's (like it or not) ability to grab a listener's, uh, attention, the YYY's at their best sound less like a sleazy three-piece and more like a relentless troop battling from trenches. ""Rich"", ""Y Control"", and most of all the flawless mixture of vitriol and vulnerability in ""Maps"" are their crowning achievements, and they can release singles until the wheel of fashion finally turns and strands them at the Salvation Army, but if they don't single out any of these songs, they're missing the point.
We should all be thankful for small favors, though, as ""Pin"" at least manages to convey a fraction of the overwhelming force they have at their disposal. What it lacks in the drag-strip dynamics and pacing of ""Date with the Night"" it compensates for with a brooding ebb and flow; stilted treble chords give way to a thunderous crash distortion, but that tidal rush is back to sea before the next verse, only to repeat the cycle one more time. The lyrics imply gritty urbanity, but only in shadowy terms: ""Things are feeling thin,"" sings Karen over the tense, skeletal accompaniment, giving ""Pin"" an appropriately half-hearted, world-weary sound. It's not a frequent pose, but it's every bit as attractive as the bedroom antics Karen typically adopts, and more impressive for its relative rarity. ""I like to sleep with them/ I know, I know."" Yeah, Karen, so do we.
Even if ""Pin"" doesn't quite encapsulate the sheer power the band has at their disposal, there's also a video for it, so that's something, right? Who wouldn't want to see that? I sure as shit wouldn't not want to, but my computer choked to death on what's allegedly a ""creepy"", ""Quay Brothers-inspired"" piece of rock action, and despite all my protestations to the contrary, this pile of circuits (that's charitably one step removed from an Etch-a-Sketch) just wasn't having it. All I got were occasional still-frames as Karen O ""goes back in"" to a door, turns into an action figure of some sort, gets pins stuck in her (clever); the slide-show presentation I got made it into the worst stop-motion video ever, though, so I can't comment. It's just a video, it shouldn't take much firepower to dazzle my senses with Karen's trip through the looking glass, should it? Maybe if this machine was actually a multi-million dollar supercomputer that was just pretending to be obsolete, it would've run properly...
Wiat what? Was that a dig at the Yeah Yeah Yeahs? Just a little, but hell, my temporary case of techno-envy makes me want to tear up my trucker's cap in bitter defeat. What can I say? So no in-depth symbolism analysis, no talk of Christ-analogs or phallic portrayals, folks; I'm as disappointed as you are, but just remember that whatever I say here about the music (the meat of any album), the disc also includes a video (the gristle). I hear it's good. It'd better be, too, because when you come right down to it, the meat of this thing is only fair. ""Pin""'s qualified strengths aside, the unmistakable failing of this EP remains that the YYY's seemingly have yet to realize where their strengths lie as a band-- and for a group with so much potential, it's infuriating to witness yet another wrong turn.
Yet, somehow, the YYY's continue to surprise me; they steer into the skid and end up in totally foreign territory. The last time they tried to navigate the sticky terrain of ""experimental"" mixes (with a fuzzy, indistinct rendering of ""Pin"", no less) on the disastrous Machine EP, they seemed hopelessly lost; it's a wonder they made it back in time to record their album. If the B-sides of this single shows anything, though, it's that they learned from their mistakes. The ""Pandaworksforthecops"" remix of ""Rich"" crosses the haunting harmonic backing of the original with ""Jingle Bells"" and a drummers convention; while Nick and Karen overdose on valium, Brian pulls out all the percussive stops-- bells that are singularly disconcerting in their monotony, an overpowering drum loop, and ghostly stick clattering in the background-- running roughshod over mumbled lyrics and faintly plucked strings.
Only hypnotic whole tones reminiscent of the original keep it recognizable as anything other than a totally new composition, but its brilliant bleakness only serves to clear the set for baffling, if weirdly impressive, finale: a cover of Liars' ""Mr. You're on Fire, Mr."" I'll concede this: in simple, broad strokes, the YYY's have managed to cover Liars in a way that band would surely be proud of; everything outside of the most explicit defining characteristics of the original, the rawest of the raw essentials, is hollowed out and discarded. Zinner's guitar is distorted to lifeless tones, Chase provides nothing beyond a lone snare hit in terrifying rhythm to pace the track, and the lyrics are beyond indecipherable, Karen's voice barely more than a distorted, lazy shriek through the course of the song.
It's utterly pulseless: a draining, yawning void in place of Liars' tightly wound dance-punk mania, and in some ways, it's incredibly smart. Nothing could be closer in spirit to the Liars' ever-present desire to stay one step ahead of expectations, even if it's not an easy thing to take in and of itself. Just when it seemed like the YYY's could still be nothing but a talented one-trick pony (and luckily for all involved), they demonstrate some unexpected depth beyond even the beauty of ""Maps"". The B-sides of this single carry the day, actually building on the off-kilter rock of ""Pin"", turning the jittery, brittle nerves to some good use after all. Now the real is question is not whether they can learn from past errors, but current successes, and that remains to be seen; after all, even a one trick pony can get lucky.

Show Your Bones,Yeah Yeah Yeahs,2006,6.8,"New York band follows its debut album Fever to Tell-- this decade's gold standard for transcending indie hype-- with a record that offers only one side of the group's multifaceted sound.
","It's impossible not to hear the ghost of Fever to Tell on the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' follow-up, Show Your Bones. With its 2003 full-length debut, the Brooklyn-based trio confidently staked out diverse territory-- from the meltdown-rock of ""Pin"" to the march of ""Black Tongue"" to the tenderly skewed balladry of ""Maps""-- and played those extremes against each other, so that each became even more extreme in contrast. The result was a complex sound that was simultaneously inviting and confrontational, and it made Fever to Tell this decade's gold standard for transcending indie hype. But while it makes sense for the YYYs to play off that earlier sound here, their new album sounds like only one side of a multifaceted band.
For Bones, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs recruited producer Squeak E. Clean, who fits these songs with an array of bells and whistles-- not to mention sirens, organs, programmed beats, acoustic guitars, rattling percussion, keyboards, and various studio effects. Most of it, unfortunately, simply seems unnecessary or excessive. In fact, more often than not, these sonic geegaws detract from the band's intensity, compartmentalizing the record's explosive moments from the songs themselves.
Nick Zinner's guitar sounds smaller and less commanding here, and Karen O has toned down her presence considerably, rarely relying on the vocal tics that once seemed the equivalent of her famously ragtag glam fashion. Even when she unleashes that hellfire growl in ""Fancy"", it's buried so far in the mix that it's indistinguishable from the band's racket. Brian Chase's drum work remains confoundingly intricate, but seems strangely restrained nonetheless. The percussion should punish your eardrums when he pounds out the opening of ""Fancy""; instead it sounds polite, like he's clearing his throat to get your attention. When the Yeah Yeah Yeahs finally do cut loose at the frenzied end of the Strokes-fest ""Mysteries"", the moment has a get-it-all-out-now feel.
These are growing pains for a band that has done a lot of maturing since Fever to Tell made them semistars. This newfound wisdom has its benefits, chief among them a confessional tone to the songwriting that effectively blurs the distinctions between Karen O and Karen Orzalek. Show Your Bones is a post-fame album, with many songs written from the specific perspective of a touring musician. ""Warrior"" begins as an acoustic ballad much like the previous album's ""Modern Romance"", but builds linearly to an intense finish as Karen O laments, ""Travel away, travel it all away/ The road's gonna end on me."" She never lapses into self-pity, though, mainly because the attraction of an excited audience proves as strong as the pull of a stable, homebound life. First single ""Gold Lion"" sounds like a mission statement: ""We'll build a fire in your eyes.""
For its faults, howeveer, Show Your Bones contains some genuinely disarming moments that reveal the band's considerable emotional and sonic force. Despite its similarity to Love and Rockets' ""No New Tale to Tell"", ""Gold Lion"" unleashes a booming wordless chorus and a high-flying guitar riff from Zinner. On ""Way Out""-- perhaps the album's most effectively dramatic track-- O infuses her vocals with a palpable emotional fatigue, sounding desperate to reconnect with the world even as she slowly sinks into numbness: ""It's around me so tight!""
Still, on Show Your Bones the Yeah Yeah Yeahs occupy only one corner of the territory they claimed on Fever, walking confidently in their own footsteps but without claiming any new ground. If Fever had a skuzzy film of sweat and alcohol that sounded persuasively real, with songs that could have been cobbled together from scraps found in garbage bins and dumpsters, unmade beds and mess-strewn rooms, Bones possesses a too-clean sound and a songwriterly approach that seems more redolent of the studio than the stage. These refinements, which prove merely cosmetic, sap their sound of its brutal spontaneity and mute the band members' idiosyncrasies, and as a result, the album sounds guarded, with very little danger and too few moments of real urgency.

Wolfmother,Wolfmother,2006,7.5,"Debut LP from the hyped Australian band, one of a handful of artists hell-bent on making heavy rock a sizable force in the 2006 musical landscape.
","Australia's Wolfmother are one of a handful of bands hell-bent on making heavy rock a sizable force in 2006. Their sound is a throwback to 1970s hard rock-- miles of galloping riffs, noodling organ, and guitar fuzz-- but what makes their self-titled debut rise above mere pastiche is how capably they strike a balance between meaty vintage metal and crisp, stoner-rock melodies.
Typically, Wolfmother plays it straight, employing the raw materials of some of the original prog/metal bands signed to England's Vertigo Records during the label's 1969-71 prime: ""Colossal"" booms with heavy power chords and woozy riffing, while frontman Andrew Stockdale's crisp vocals soar through the rhythm's open spaces, while ""Woman"" is a driving, upbeat monster with spacey prog-inflected keyboards. But they also test their limits on tracks like ""The White Unicorn"". Its opening bars recall Led Zeppelin's gentler side with clean-strummed guitar chords and Stockdale putting on his best Robert Plant, but tumbling drumfills inevitably welcome back the rock, leading up to a blissed-out, psychedelic bridge.
""Where Eagles Have Been"" best spans the album's breadth: clean guitars turn dirty, organs wail during the transitions, and the slow and intense rhythm becomes upbeat and explosive just in time for the guitar solo. On ""Witchcraft"", the band evokes Jethro Tull with a Canterbury flute solo that ought to sound forced or hokey, but context is everything, and set against Wolfmother's wallop, it's a natural fit. Of course, not all their risks return rewards as worthwhile: The obnoxious three-and-a-half-minute garage-punk blast ""Apple Tree"" features the album's most uninspired songwriting and laziest delivery. Fortunately, they manage to take things out on a high note with the swampy ""Vegabond"", a track that, like much of this record's other material, authentically emulates a classic sound with the conviction and hunger of a young band on their way to finding a more singular voice.

Ride Me Back Home,Willie Nelson,2019,7.4,"Old age suits the country singer well. On his latest album—featuring three newly penned tunes—Willie sings with a kind of chagrinned humor, as if nobody is more surprised by his longevity than he is.
","Perhaps the only thing more impressive than the fact that Willie Nelson is still at it—it being writing, recording, touring, and toking—is the fact that he’s still good at it. These 86 years seem to have sharpened his focus and his sense of humor, so there’s not that feeling he’s going through the motions when he plays “On the Road Again” for the millionth time. Nearly six decades after he wrote “Crazy,” he has largely avoided the pitfalls that have snared so many older country and rock artists, instead emerging as a grandfatherly influence for yet another generation of country misfits like Sturgill Simpson and Margo Price (both of whom played Willie’s Outlaw Music Festival last year). To be active, relevant, and beloved as an octogenarian in the business—that’s the dream of any artist.
In recent years, Willie has even managed to enter something of a renaissance phase of his career, with a string of albums that include his first new songwriting credits in decades. Apart from his largely overlooked collection of Sinatra covers (which I’ll argue surpasses Dylan’s handful in terms of interpretation, insight, and just plain ol’ enjoyment), he has made his own thoughts on mortality, technology, and creativity the focal points of his recent work. Old age is his new favorite subject, or the subject he knows most intimately, or maybe just the subject that lends itself to the best punchlines. He sings with a kind of chagrinned humor, as if nobody is more surprised by his longevity than he is.
That’s a welcome trend that continues on Ride Me Back Home, which features three newly penned tunes. That doesn’t seem like very many, but they frame this album with warmth, empathy, and humor. “Come On Time” finds him challenging the very notion of time to a fight, as though he might spar his way to another couple years on earth. “I say come on, Time/I’ve beat you before,” he sings over a chugging rhythm section. “Come on, Time, what have you got for me this time?” His desperation barely veiled by his humor, he knows he’s bested before the fight even begins, and all he can do is try to make something out of it: “I’ll take your words of wisdom and I’ll try to make them rhyme.”
Buying the farm, at least for Willie, is inextricably linked with making music. “One More Song to Write” sounds so breezy that its insights might initially sound modest, but this gracefully melodic tune might hold the key to his long career. “I’ve got one more song to write, I’ve got one more bridge to burn,” he sings. “I’ll know when it’s right, I’ve got one more song to write.” For all his prolificity—is there even an authoritative album count anymore?—he’s always chasing that next tune, that next rhyme, that next show. He’s always thinking about the future.
It doesn’t really matter to Willie who came up with that next tune or that next rhyme. At his best, he can rewrite a song just by singing it, and he can suss out new depths just by adapting it to his own jazzy meter. The slight delay in his delivery on Guy Clark’s “Immigrant Eyes” subtly reinforces the song’s dusty two-step rhythm as well as its very timely sentiments about family, immigration, and empathy. Likewise, he capers over the lyrics of Mac Davis’s “It’s Hard to Be Humble,” having a blast singing the word “egotistical” and chuckling with his sons Lukas and Micah over the notion of him wearing “skintight blue jeans.”
Ride Me Back Home is Willie’s thirteenth album with producer/co-writer Buddy Cannon, the Pancho to his Lefty, and it casually evokes the old Texas dancehalls where Willie cut his teeth long before he embodied the outlaw country ethos. There’s a roominess to the music, a jovial looseness in its rhythmic complexity, and something like celebration in its exploration of these grave subjects. Nothing on here sounds rehearsed or calculated. Instead, it sounds like Willie has been living with these songs for so long that he can play them as easily as inhaling and exhaling.

Adiós,Glen Campbell,2017,5.7,"The new record from 1960s hitmaker Glen Campbell is intended as his last. It’s a pleasant postscript, collecting covers of Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson, among others.
","Glen Campbell bid a public farewell in 2012, playing his last concert roughly a year after he announced he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Improbably, the illness provided a coda to Campbell’s career; he quickly released four albums, culminating with this year’s Adiós. Considering his debilitating illness, this productivity is remarkable. But it has also been noteworthy as Campbell’s longest stretch of secular records since 1993’s Somebody Like That. He spent the next 15 years in a wilderness of Christian music and re-recordings before reemerging in 2008 with Meet Glen Campbell, an album designed to evoke memories of his plush 1960s hits while relying on songs from modern rockers. The skillful balance of relatively contemporary tunes—Paul Westerberg’s “Sadly, Beautiful” may have been old enough to drive by the time Campbell cut it—and classic production created the template for Campbell’s final years.
Like 2011’s Ghost on the Canvas, Adiós sounds as rich and detailed as any of his ’60s work, but that’s not the only similarity they share. Ghost on the Canvas was also billed as Campbell’s final album, but its supporting farewell tour did well enough to produce a documentary—I’ll Be Me, released in 2014 accompanied by a soundtrack album—and to convince Campbell and his team that the singer could record one more album, Adiós. It’s difficult to discern the precise sense of agency Campbell has had with any of the music he’s recorded while suffering from Alzheimer’s. All of these records allude to the idea of mortality. The very titles of Ghost on the Canvas and 2013’s See You There suggest Campbell has already left this world; I’ll Be Me’s new song “I’m Not Gonna Miss You” is a direct reference to his loss of memory.
Adiós doesn’t hard sell Campbell’s impending death as aggressively as its predecessors, but his imminent departure hangs over the proceedings, articulated clearly in its album title and surfacing on the margins via covers of Willie Nelson’s “Funny How Time Slips Away.” Mortality may be pushed toward the surface on Adiós, but this is an album intended to convey happiness, not darkness. Look at the artwork, which depicts a cheery, chipper Campbell. It’s a far cry from the spectre looming on the cover of Ghost on the Canvas, the fatalistic block type of See You There, or the haunted younger photo gracing I’ll Be Me. Adiós seemingly intends to offer a hopeful spin to a tragic story.
It succeeds, to an extent. Certainly, it offers comfort in a way none of its companion records do. Producer Carl Jackson picks up the throwback sensibility of Julian Raymond and Howard Willing—the pair who produced Meet Glen Campbell and Ghost on the Canvas—so Adiós feels like a cousin to Campbell’s lush ’60s and ’70s hits. Such warmth underpins the working thesis that this is the record the singer always wanted to make—the songs he never got around to cutting in his prime—and it also disguises how Campbell’s range has diminished, a welcome move after the stark See You There placed his flaws in the forefront. Here, his voice is just supple enough to lend some sweetness to melodies that demand a gentle touch, many of them written by Jimmy Webb, a songwriter who always brought out the best in Campbell.
Four of Webb’s compositions, all taken from his 1993 album Suspending Disbelief, comprise a third of Adiós. Those songs, along with the Miller tune, are the highlights of the album because they are perched on the precipice of the past and the present. They’re not overly familiar in the vein of the album’s take on “Everybody’s Talkin’”—presented in an arrangement that mimics Harry Nilsson’s hit—or “Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right.” They feel like they could be part of a new Campbell album that lacked any biographical baggage. Of course, such a record couldn’t exist. Campbell’s tragic story is woven into the marketing of Adiós, and the album was indeed created as a last testament from a legend; it is impossible to hear without the context of the rest of his career. Adiós doesn't add much to Campbell’s legacy—the comeback records of recent years formed a fitting final act—but it’s a pleasant postscript, a wistful reminder of the joys a great musician once gave.

Ghost on the Canvas,Glen Campbell,2011,6.5,"Recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's, this living legend of pop crafts a final, surprisingly upbeat retirement album, one that never stoops to self-pity and very modestly reminds you of past triumphs. The set includes new songs by Paul Westerberg and Robert Pollard and guest spots from Billy Corgan, the Dandy Warhols, and more.
","Recently, Glen Campbell received the kind of diagnosis that everyone of a certain age dreads: Alzheimer's. Before the disease grows worse, he decided to record one final album and launch one final tour, and while most celebrity retirements seem suspect (ahem, Jay-Z, Patrick Wolf, Ryan Adams, and on and on), this one really does feel permanent, which is tragic. Campbell has had one of those impossible careers that sound more like the stuff of outrageous fiction than rock biography: An Arkansas native and music prodigy of sorts, he moved to L.A. and played in a band called the Champs (Tequila!) and worked as a member of the infamous Wrecking Crew, a group of studio musicians who backed Elvis Presley and Simon & Garfunkel and played on Phil Spector's infamous wall-of-sound recordings. That's him laying down licks on Pet Sounds, while he was a touring Beach Boy. In the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, he scored huge hits with ""Wichita Lineman"" and ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix"" (both by Jimmy Webb, long overdue for a retrospective). Often dismissed as a practitioner of slick country-pop, he favored florid strings, stately vocals, and an interpretive approach most likely informed by his experience as a sideman. ""Rhinestone Cowboy"" pretty much sums up the contradictions of his music, which is simultaneously country but urbane, slick but still soulful.
Perhaps because he was a Nashville outsider but not a Nashville outlaw, Ghost on the Canvas sidesteps all the current conventions of country farewell albums, a growing subgenre that found its apotheosis in Johnny Cash's later recordings and Kris Kristofferson's recent pair of affairs-settling records. This is no tastefully solemn acoustic affair, with a hushed tone communicating a kind of easy-read mortal gravity. Instead, Campbell conveys a certain nostalgia for that defining sound of his prime-- or at least a nostalgia for a time when that sound was popular. ""It's Your Amazing Grace"" and ""A Thousand Lifetimes"" deploy the same tricks he's been using for decades-- those ornate string arrangements and prominent guitar themes that recall fellow Wrecking Crew member Jack Nitzsche-- but they sound fresh on these tracks, even at times adventurous. The short, instrumental interstitials are distracting as Campbell tries to cover every corner of his history, but the the presence of Billy Corgan, Cheap Trick's Rick Nielsen, and all the Dandy Warhols on Ghost suggests that the influence of this style has been, at the very least, broad.
Campbell is still taking stock of his life and career (""Sometimes I get confused, Lord/ My past gets in my way""), and that sounds odd only because it's not something he has not historically been inclined to do: He's more renowned as a sensitive vocalist than as a confessional songwriter. So songs like ""A Better Place"" and ""There's No Me… Without You"", both co-penned with producer Julian Raymond, sound perhaps a bit too direct for Campbell, although his voice remains strong enough that he doesn't need your pity to put these songs across, no matter how silly some of their sentiments. Anchoring Ghost is a handful of covers that are perhaps only slightly less adventurous than those on his 2008 album, Meet Glen Campbell. The title track and ""Any Trouble"" are lesser Westerberg, but they fit the album's theme all too well. Likewise, ""Hold on Hope"" is an obvious GBV choice (what, you expected ""Tractor Rape Chain""?), but Campbell owns its schmaltz as well as its simple optimism, suggesting that Bob Pollard wrote the line ""there hides the cowboy"" with Campbell in mind. Ghost is nowhere near his best, most consistent, or most durable album, but that's ultimately not even the right way to measure its modest accomplishment. Instead, it's a surprisingly upbeat retirement album, one that never stoops to self-pity and very modestly reminds you of past triumphs.

The Adornment of Time,Tyshawn Sorey,2019,8.0,"A live recording from New York’s the Kitchen captures a rare kind of improv synergy between the versatile composer-percussionist and a pianist who rose to fame in Anthony Braxton’s quartet.
","The composer and multi-instrumentalist Tyshawn Sorey has been spoiling audiences in a variety of jazz and classical scenes over the last few years. It’s easy to assume that he’s always in a recording studio somewhere: documenting his excellent trio; working as a percussionist in bands led by colleagues like Vijay Iyer and Steve Lehman; producing expansive, multi-hour pieces that engage with drone-music mysticism. But that substantial discography is hardly the whole story.
His recent song cycle, “Cycles of My Being,” was written for the tenor Lawrence Brownlee (and has played at Carnegie Hall and Opera Philadelphia). A 2018 appearance at New York’s Jazz Gallery, during which Sorey performed on a modified piano alongside the saxophonist Hafez Modirzadeh, was a reminder that his work as a keyboardist has not been given enough attention. A few months later, a production of Sorey’s dramatic work inspired by Josephine Baker, with a text by Claudia Rankine, proved mesmerizing on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s grand staircase.
Yet even as his reach has broadened, Sorey has also kept working in more intimate formats. His latest record, a duo set with the veteran pianist Marilyn Crispell, is a freely improvised meeting recorded live at the Kitchen, a longtime New York experimental haven.
The album’s first act—particularly its first 20 minutes—is dominated by hushed and haunted timbres from both players. Approximately half an hour in, we get the first hint of tumult, a mood that develops, thrashes around, crests, and subsides over another quarter hour. An extended, closing coda brings to mind the beginning section while also highlighting the distance these performers have traveled.
On the surface, this might seem a standard free-improv sequence, and therefore less notable than Sorey’s hyper-conceptual projects. But this composer lives to mess with surface-level thinking. And thanks to his distaste for categorizing music—particularly when it comes to genre definitions—listeners should always be prepared for ambition and thoughtfulness, no matter the format.
Not surprisingly, across this unbroken 64-minute improvisation Crispell proves to be an ideal partner for such a non-hierarchical musical mind. Her own rise to prominence came, during the 1980s, as the pianist in saxophonist and composer Anthony Braxton’s “classic” quartet (a group whose recordings Sorey remembers admiring as a teen in the liner notes for this album).
During those vintage, marathon performances, preserved on albums like Quartet (Birmingham) 1985, Crispell often played one of Braxton’s notated solo-piano pieces while the band’s other members played parts from other Braxton works. The collage-style results tended to be bracing, but always in a musical fashion—in part due to Crispell’s keen ability for listening intently amid a whirlwind.
Crispell’s responsiveness is still in elite, extraordinary shape here. Her percussive, avant-jazz technique gets plenty of room to roam during a section of high-drama pummeling; check out the swinging density she produces 34 minutes into the set.
But her feel for momentum is also present during many of the performance's quieter passages, during which the pianist’s ideas clearly inspire choices made by the drummer. (It helps that Sorey’s kit is outfitted with gongs and other forms of pitched percussion, the better to merge with melodies coming from Crispell’s instrument.) In these moments, The Adornment of Time doesn’t merely present two talented musicians in a room, improvising at the same time. Instead, the album makes good on ideals at the heart of the free-improv tradition—including equality and adaptiveness—that are often paid lip service, if not always easily heard.

Verisimilitude,Tyshawn Sorey,2017,7.6,"If the jazz and experimental drummer’s work in other bands often suggests an irrepressible mania, the goal with this trio seems to be delicate chaos.
","Tyshawn Sorey is one of contemporary music’s most adroit thrashers. To hear him in an ensemble led by saxophonist Steve Lehman or pianist Vijay Iyer is to enter a mind-altering rhythmic chamber. The tempo of a song may start out at a swinging pace. Then you hear a pivot that sounds like a reference to a Dilla motif. Next, it’s being spun through the wringer of free jazz. It’s easy to understand why lots of elite musicians like to have this guy in a band or  why Questlove calls Sorey one of his “drumming heroes.”
As a composer, Sorey is no less bold. But his adventurism has adopted a different profile on his most recent albums for the Pi label. The Inner Spectrum of Variables, a double-disc set from 2016, used an unconventional string quartet to fill out some of Sorey’s contemporary classical designs. On 2014’s Alloy—a trio recording with pianist Corey Smythe and bassist Chris Tordini—the finale was a half-hour composition titled “A Love Song.” Over its first half, the way Smythe meditated over some of Sorey’s modes encouraged you to forget the piece’s claim to jazz-born tenderness. This hint of misdirection allowed the gradual entry of Tordini and Sorey himself to sound all the more ravishing.
Verisimilitude is this trio’s follow-up to Alloy. While it can fit on a single CD, it has an epic scale that follows from the wide-ranging air of Inner Spectrum. And though it never strays from its languid style, the brief opening track “Cascade in Slow Motion” reveals how Sorey can put his compositional materials under pressure. At first, Smythe’s piano picks over the scalar melody, while Sorey accompanies, quietly. Gradually, the drummer puts some more tumult into the ensemble’s texture. Still, it’s the softest kind of full-boil imaginable. If his work in other bands often suggests an irrepressible mania, the goal here seems to be delicate chaos.
Most of the following track, “Flowers for Prashant,” is similarly pensive—until a figure that sounds descended from Middle Eastern music sweeps into frame in the final minutes along with airy wisps of electronic processing. The third movement, “Obsidian,” flows without interruption from this same digital environment. That vibe is interrupted only when Smythe moves over to produce stark, plinking lines from a toy piano. (John Cage liked the instrument, too, but the use of it in a trio format presents new expressive possibilities.)
By the time of the centerpiece, the half-hour long “Algid November,” Sorey’s group makes the most of its deep experience together. Smythe knows how to uncork a fiery line of pianism—bringing a spare section to an unceremonious end—at just the right moment. Throughout, the use of electronics is so restrained that it can be easy to miss. But a gorgeous new melody in the tenth minute refreshes the listener’s patience, with its assurance that not every change in the music is going to be about such fine-grain distinctions. Even as the group recoils from seeming overbearing or obvious, its use of textural opposites—like sustain and dryness—creates a powerful narrative. That all the variety here comes from the work of three players is a marvel. It’s almost frightening to imagine what Sorey could conceive, with a full orchestra at his disposal. The right experimental music impresario should give him the chance.

Wet Will Always Dry,Blawan,2018,7.2,"The UK techno titan’s debut album is a display of his sound-design prowess—as well as a reminder that even the heaviest techno needn’t shy from the pleasures of weirdo pop.
","Two minutes into “Careless,” the second song on Blawan’s debut album, Wet Will Always Dry, something unexpected happens: The UK techno don’s voice wafts into the mix, his airy tone suggesting a Belle and Sebastian B-side blown across the festival field. For a producer whose best-known song—2012’s monstrous “Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage?”—hangs off a distorted vocal hook that hints at murder, the contrast is eye-opening. It introduces a rejuvenating tinge of vulnerability into Blawan’s sometimes stony techno.
The move is not entirely without precedent. Since launching his Ternesc label in 2015, Blawan (aka Jamie Roberts) has eased off the terrible intensity of “Bodies” and his thunderous work with Pariah as Karenn; that softening has coincided with him turning to modular synthesis to produce his music. Roberts’ twin 2016 EPs as Bored Young Adults and Kilner showcased a more introverted take on electronics, while 2017’s Nutrition EP hinted at tenderness within the thunder.
Even so, that cobweb-light voice on “Careless” is an unexpected highlight on an album that subtly turns up the color on Blawan’s hard-nosed production sound. It’s not just that the vocal is fragile; it also has a hook that you could find yourself muttering in the shower several days later. This is the closest Blawan has come to weirdo pop music since “Bodies” or 2011’s bumping “Getting Me Down.” His knack for an understated vocal hook shows up again on “Stell,” where his wistful voice anchors insolently squelching synths in a piece of electronic music that feels designed for staring out the window on an overcast day.
Musical color is also evident in the fantastically visceral sounds that elevate Wet Will Always Dry above the techno horde. Album opener “Klade” is built around a droning noise that evokes the feeling of lying in the long grass watching planes pass overhead, while “North” layers a springy, insistent synth line over what sounds like a bag of potato chips being thrown on the fire. It helps that the album’s mix is bathed in a satisfying sonic warmth whose rich timbre does for the ears what the smell of polished wood does for the nose.
Odd hooks and noises might not sound like enough to sustain an eight-track album. But Blawan has a way of drawing out the subtle drama in his sounds, playing on the tension between the elasticity of the instrumental lines and the tightly wound percussive structure. The rubbery harp-pluck effect on “Nims,” for example, is forever threatening to veer out of control, only to be brought back in line by the click and thud of the regimented drum line. The album only falters when these touches aren’t enough to sustain interest. “Tasser” and “Vented” both feature hugely satisfying noises—the former resembling the ominous, metallic buildup of a sea storm, the latter a ruler being twanged in the bowels of hell—but neither is developed sufficiently to raise their respective tracks above post-Jeff Mills loopery.
Wet Will Always Dry isn’t an album that will rewire dance music or revolutionize modern electronics, but at its best it succeeds in pushing against the expectations of modern techno, bringing vulnerability, warmth, and oodles of enchanting noises to a musical genre whose pursuit of the future sometimes seems to have gotten lost in po-faced respect for the past. Wet Will Always Dry is tender, intense, and dramatic. But most of all it is fun, in a way that only the pursuit of the most ludicrous aural stimulation can be.

Hanging Out the Birds EP,Blawan,2015,7.3,"To speak the UK producer Blawan's name feels vaguely like mouthing an explosion, and his music, full of jackhammering kicks, splintered wooden percussion, and short-fuse breakdowns, has followed suit. But Blawan's latest work, made entirely with modular synthesizers, displays a much subtler approach.
","Blawan has always come across as kind of a bruiser. Consider the tattoos on the UK producer's knuckles—""KICK"" on the right, ""DRUM"" on the left—or the fact that his chosen alias reads like an onomatopoeic transcription of comic-book violence. His name feels vaguely like mouthing an explosion, and his music has followed suit. Full of jackhammering kicks, splintered wooden percussion, and short-fuse breakdowns, it's typically as volatile as a coffee-tin full of gunpowder.
Granted, Blawan's music has never been hard simply for the sake of being hard: Just see ""Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage"", in which he flips a Fugees sample into what sounds like the unhinged ranting of a serial killer and then piles screams and clangs and abattoir-grade reverb on top. That campy-scary tune, released in 2012, turned into an unexpected breakout hit: It's racked up close to a million plays on YouTube, Skrillex was playing it in his sets for a while, and the Irish quartet Girl Band even covered the song, returning it to the slash-and-burn punk rock that obviously inspired it.
But Blawan's latest releases display a much subtler approach. The change is right there in the title of the recent inaugural EP on his TERNESC label: Warm Tonal Touch. He's been making music with an all-hardware setup for a while now, but the first two records on his new label represent a new set of limitations, having been made entirely with modular synthesizers. You wouldn't necessarily know that from listening to them; where many modular users slip down rabbit-holes of complex evolving sequences or get tangled up in cat's cradles of blips and blurps, Blawan uses his machines more for color and shading—darkly lustrous streaks, silvery scribbles, crushed chalk smeared against a backdrop of woven Kevlar. It's not self-consciously ""synthesizer music"" in the way that a lot of modular creations are; it's still techno to the core.
The drums still come first, and they, too, are sourced from his modular setup. Why does this matter? It might not to the dancers, but for anyone interested in the myriad decisions that happen between turning on a power strip and turning out a finished track, it's notable that he's opted to go without the standard-issue kicks and snares that animate 99.99% of dance records; instead, he's carved his sounds from scratch, sculpting white noise into scratchy patterns that approximate techno's boom-tick template without simply replicating it. In ""Hanging Out the Birds"" and ""Mine Oh Mine"", the beats move in rippling patterns untethered to anything as obvious as a bass drum; instead of pumping in time to techno's conventional throb, they seem to slide across the surface, like water striders. ""Hanging Out the Birds"" is strangely relaxed and fleshed out with diffuse, almost beatific tones; ""Mine Oh Mine"", with its rapid-fire pitter-pat and chromatic churn, is a nail-biter made even more nerve-wracking by its refusal to reach anything like a climax. Only a soothing spoken-word bit offers the occasional respite from the roil.
With its heavier pulse and whip-cracking backbeats, ""Weakening Force"" is more like Blawan's previous records, but it sounds like it's been sanded down and worn away; it is to his more full-bodied work as a grave rubbing is to the granite slab. The heaviest (and best) of the bunch is ""Diatonic Valves"", which charges forward like a lawnmower chewing up gravel and yet still manages to be graceful, even lyrical, even though the sole melodic element is a banshee's wail that snakes dolefully through the upper register. For being so stripped down and so rough around the edges, it packs an incredible amount of tone, and emotion, into its swollen midrange, bringing to mind the ragged-yet-ethereal sound of Basic Channel at their most relentless. It's a tantalizing glimpse of where Blawan might go next—sheathing the tats in velvet gloves without sacrificing an ounce of force.

Weezer (The Black Album),Weezer,2019,5.7,"Weezer reflects on their own capricious history, using a blunt force the likes of which they’ve never deployed before.
","In 1998, two years after Pinkerton debuted to poor reviews, Rivers Cuomo retreated to a one-room bedsit beneath a Los Angeles freeway. He painted the walls and ceilings black, and on the windows, he layered black bed-sheets over thick fiberglass insulation. Devastated by the negative response to Pinkerton, and frustrated by an unproductive spate of rehearsals, he withdrew from his band, and then from the world. For months on end, he hid in his unlit bedroom, depressed, never going outside, never speaking to another human being. “I’d start to have some of the darkest thoughts and fears and feelings,” he said. “I’d think, ‘Man, maybe I’m never going to get out of this.’”
Similar stories abound of songwriters so adept at articulating sadness they became suffused in the feeling. These stories don’t often end happily. But Cuomo is a marvelous anomaly: he emerged from his depression, sought help via psychotherapy and meditation, and reunited with his band to create, over several decades, an immense body of work. The only small wrinkle in this narrative is that body of work is famously reviled among fans and critics alike. On this latest album, Weezer reflects on their own capricious history, using a blunt force the likes of which they’ve never deployed before.
Actually, “blunt” might be an understatement: Cuomo chants, “Die, die, you zombie bastards” a dozen times. It’s a forceful rebuke of Leslie Jones and her ilk. When, on the same track, he sings, “Music saved my life,” the platitude lays plain an ugly truth: Weezer’s masterpiece was produced during a period of painful dysregulation and remains mired in racist bigotry. Fans who clamor for a second Pinkerton are propping up an emotionally stunted corpse; Mitski is shoveling loam onto his grave. Throughout Weezer (The Black Album), Cuomo pleads with listeners to follow him past Pinkerton, and out of that dark apartment. “I lived my life,” he sings, “and that’s much better than hiding in a hole.”
Weezer’s foremost lyrical priority, then, is to shuck the expectations of their perennially disappointed fanbase. The band attacks this project from every angle: cynical sneering at the pressures of commercialization (“Can’t Knock the Hustle”), wistful longing for artistry without an audience (“High as a Kite”), and the aforementioned open death threats of “Zombie Bastards.” The production, too, rarely bears even a passing resemblance to the power pop that first endeared Weezer to listeners. They’ve enlisted TV on the Radio’s Dave Sitek to draft a set of soundscapes that range from bossa nova to Blink-182. In an era where recommendation engines swaddle listeners in cozy familiarity, it’s refreshing to see so much stylistic variation from track to track.
But this striving for the new and different comes at a cost. There’s no emotional throughline on The Black Album, no grand statement that continues from one track to the next. The songs never blur together, but they also don’t tell a story as the sum of their parts. A sense of tonal whiplash ensues, and the album’s highlights are best enjoyed in isolation. “Byzantine” goes down like a bubbly flute of champagne, a sweet, slinky narrative of infidelity spilling out over a laissez-faire lounge beat. On “The Prince Who Wanted Everything,” co-written with rhythm guitarist Brian Bell, Cuomo sings knotty lines like “all the courtiers will genuflect,” clearly relishing each and every syllable that clicks between his teeth. And “I’m Just Being Honest,” a genuinely hysterical ode on the pitfalls of constructive criticism, lands like Weezer doing a spot-on Lonely Island parody of themselves: “I listened to it, but halfway through it, I had to quit; your band sounds like shit.”
Elsewhere, The Black Album stumbles when Cuomo opts for universality over specificity. “Living in L.A.” smothers its interesting ideas under broad brush strokes. “Piece of Cake” is a shallow, plodding re-tread of the White Album stand-out “Do You Wanna Get High?” The album’s final track, “California Snow,” borders on disastrous: over skittering, “Sicko Mode”-esque drums, Cuomo spits, “This is the definition of flow! Nobody cold as this!” and then he sings about cocaine for three and a half minutes. Cuomo’s songwriting on substance abuse, once so direct and delicate, sinks to maudlin depths here; the invocation of Judas in this song’s bridge can’t match the bruising betrayal conveyed in, “You cleaned up/Found Jesus.”
In recent months, Weezer’s been focused on light-hearted, crowd-pleasing viral videos: Finn Wolfhard donning a wild glam-rock mullet to play a teenage Cuomo, Weird Al suiting up in bowl cut, cardigan, and Buddy Holly glasses. At first blush, the band’s new video for “High as a Kite” appears to be more of the same, with Cuomo wearing a red sweater and greeting a crowd of pre-schoolers for a taping of “Mister Rivers’ Neighborhood.” But as the band’s performance gathers steam, the dark subtext beneath the song’s optimism reveals itself. Smiles slough off the toddlers’ faces, giving way to wobbly pouting. Their parents knit their eyebrows, weary, visibly distressed by the rock’n’roll carnage unfolding. The final shot all but defines the current moment of Weezer: The audience has cleared out entirely, leaving a vast expanse of empty black seats and bare black walls. On the soundstage, Weezer stands triumphant in the wreckage, soaked in light.

Pacific Daydream,Weezer,2017,4.3,"On their 11th album, Rivers Cuomo and co. aim for a hook-filled tribute to California guitar pop but the production gloss suffocates any personality these songs could have had.
","Long ago, Rivers Cuomo basically split Weezer into two different bands. One of them puts out experimental albums (Pinkerton, Maladroit, The Red Album, etc.), and the other puts out commercially-minded records (The Green Album, Make Believe, etc). At times (The Blue Album, Everything Will Be Alright in the End), Weezer straddle the fence. There’s a bit of mad genius to this approach. Not only does Cuomo—something of a creative contrarian who’s been ultra-reactive to fan response in the past—get to buck expectations when he wants to, but he also gets to appease both sides of the aisle.
If you like hooky Weezer, about half of the albums should appeal to you, while the same applies if you’re partial to the more out-there Weezer. Pacific Daydream is the band’s first offering to fall far short for both camps—not because it’s one of the most extreme examples of Cuomo going for a radio-friendly sound (though it is that), but because he betrays the band’s mission in the process. This is all the more disappointing when you consider that even when Cuomo churns out dance-pop fluff such as “Feels Like Summer,” it’s still abundantly clear that he hasn’t lost his gift for coming up with earworm hooks.
“Weekend Woman” offers a clear example of just how these songs go wrong. Weezer have used glockenspiels for texture in the past (Pinkerton’s “Pink Triangle,” last year’s “California Kids,” etc.), but here they follow ’80s-era Cheap Trick into the void between powder-puff rock and adult contempo, and the percussion instrument is front and center. This could have turned out to be another example of Cuomo taking gutsy risks, but ""Weekend Woman"" sounds less ""spacious"" and more ""empty."" Other than the one eccentricity in the arrangement, there's little to distinguish this song from hundreds of pop songs you've forgotten about. In fact, the album is almost completely devoid of the chunking guitar riffs that sit at the core of Weezer’s soul. And on “QB Blitz,” they even manage to take the “power” out of “power ballad.”
Lyrically, Cuomo’s continued fixation on nostalgia and dime-store rock mythology further chokes what little the music may have had to offer. He tries to pass himself off as the dreamy-eyed kid you invariably find shredding at Guitar Center by including references to Mexican-made Fender guitars and Stevie Ray Vaughan, but the observations are pat, delivered without detail or conviction. And while there are moments on Pacific Daydream when Weezer take half-hearted stabs at the harmony vocals that Brian Wilson so famously seared into our musical DNA, the strangely wan “Beach Boys” isn’t one of them. Had producer Butch Walker (Avril Lavigne, P!nk, Panic! at the Disco, and Weezer’s own 2009 album Raditude) nurtured the song’s quirks, “Beach Boys” could have actually explored its hinted fusion of Latin music and reggae. The airy lead hook in the chorus even contains suggests yacht rock, a style that could do worse than to have Cuomo give it a go.
To be fair, Pacific Daydream does show us new sides of the band—splashes of Spanish guitar, clavinet—while Cuomo and fellow guitarist Brian Bell’s acoustic handiwork threads the music with a delicate touch we rarely get from Weezer. Nevertheless, toothless melodies coupled with an excess of production gloss suffocate any personality these songs could have had. When Cuomo and company do more than pay superficial lip service  to the Beach Boys, it comes off as crass—even dishonest—coming from behind the music’s thick, gleaming surface.
Looking back, it’s no surprise that Cuomo’s distinct combination of fuzzy guitar riffs, sunny hooks, unabashed awkwardness, and roiling internal conflict struck such a profound nerve. But for the second album in a row, Cuomo anchors the music more specifically to California. Sure, that’s worked for scores of artists in the past, but a crucial part of Weezer’s appeal was that you could believe they came out of any garage on any tree-lined cul-de-sac in any suburban zip code in the U.S. Pacific Daydream, in spite of its name, mostly just gives you a feeling of being nowhere.

Everything Will Be Alright in the End,Weezer,2014,6.5,"Weezer's ninth studio album features contributions from Best Coast's Bethany Cosentino, along with Blue Album producer Ric Ocasek's return to the soundboard helm. The album is one of Weezer's most enjoyable in recent memory.
","Rivers Cuomo has taken your shit for over two decades and he’s had it up to here. Midway through Weezer’s ninth studio LP, he airs his grievances on a song called, not coincidentally, “I’ve Had It Up to Here”—the most valid of which is that people think he’s somehow insincere. You could describe Weezer’s 21st century output in many derogatory ways and most of it would be warranted, but “dishonest” isn’t one of them. Pick anything he’s done over the past 15 years and ask yourself, “What label exec concerned with the bottom line would possibly cosign this?” Rivers Cuomo is making the exact kind of music he wants to make—it just so happens that it sounds like music for the masses and has no currency whatsoever. Yet, in his finest mock-operatic metal voice, Cuomo brings “I’ve Had It Up to Here” to a head with, “If you think I need approval from the faceless throng/ Well, that's where you’re wrong.” The important word here is “faceless.” Cuomo does seek approval, but on Everything Will Be Alright in the End, he realizes that he needs it from a familiar source that he knows quite well: people who may have once been Weezer fans.
That said, you’ll have to give the overt apology “Back to the Shack” a second chance, and I realize that’s a tall order—if recent Weezer has ever driven you to punch a total stranger, this one leads with the chin. There's Cuomo’s tendency to treat The Blue Album’s goodwill as a renewable resource, the lyrics peppered with meta references about Weezer’s past—namely, his lightning bolt guitar strap and that one time he let drummer Patrick Wilson sing lead. You might roll your eyes when he rhymes “rockin’ out like it’s ‘94” with “more hardcore,” and they will bug out when revisiting 1994 somehow means doing fourth-wall rhyme-bustin’ that was perfected on “El Scorcho” and responsible for “Beverly Hills”. And then there are the wincing, “What year is this?” jokes that will certainly be criticized for “lolz rockism”: taking himself to task because “I forgot that disco sucks,” thinking that the radio and “those stupid singing shows” are even in competition anymore, or that they had any effect on Weezer.
But something about this song sticks, and it’s not just the hook, though that’s a big part of it—even those who despise Weezer can admit Cuomo has an inexhaustible, infuriating ability to write melodies that lodge themselves in your brain after one listen, whether you want it there or not. During the second verse, Cuomo drops the yuks and sings, “I finally settled down with my girl and I made up with my dad.” He could not be more direct about what “Back to the Shack” truly means beyond its reprise of “Pork and Beans”'s message about being true to one’s self: those represent the twin engines that powered The Blue Album and Pinkerton’s emotional train wrecks, and there's the possibility that “Back to the Shack” might be a sly, sarcastic rebuke against armchair producers and YouTube commenters, a la Danny Brown’s Old: you don’t want the old Rivers Cuomo, so do you want him to rock out like it’s ‘94 or do you just want him to sing about it and make a record of his (broken) heart?
Because you’re only getting one in 2014, and Everything does occasionally rock out with the same joyous abandon of The Blue Album, albeit without its wide-eyed naivety. If you really want to go out on a limb, this is as close as Cuomo is getting to his own version of Benji—a rock lifer moving forward by clearing out his past, the songs almost entirely dedicated to his relationships with his career, women, and his parents. “Cleopatra” and “Foolish Father” have subjects that are pulled right from Cuomo’s mid-'90s diaries—namely, powerful women who frighten and leave Rivers Cuomo, and absentee fathers. Twenty years later, the lesson here is the futility of hating someone who likely did their best, to forgive them and to forgive yourself.
That part resonates, as does the lived-in wisdom applicable to the songs that are about being in Weezer, even when they sorta aren’t. The generality of “Eulogy for a Rock Band” actually works in its favor when you consider it could very well be about rock music itself (for cryin’ out loud, Cuomo’s favorite rock group just declared rock dead). Meanwhile, the platitudes of “Ain’t Got Nobody” give way to a startling, lucid account of Cuomo’s abandonment issues that have spanned his entire life, from childhood to confused, needy rock stardom: “My daddy loved me/ No one could touch me/ Until he went up and left me lonely/ That’s human nature/ We fail each other/ And keep on searching for another.”
Of course, Cuomo ensures that you don’t have to read that far into Everything Will Be Alright in the End, keeping the melodies up front and the gimmicks mostly in his notebook. The effect of Blue Album producer Ric Ocasek will likely be overstated: the lyrics on any previous Weezer album were not the producer’s fault, and from all accounts, the guitar tones and keyboards on that record were all Cuomo’s idea anyways. Either way, these are simple, effective songs that will settle for constant rotation in your head if MTV’s not an option: “Lonely Girl” isolates the second verse of “Only in Dreams” and reworks Cuomo’s Japanese curio “Homely Girl” into a legitimate buzzy throwback. Meanwhile, Best Coast’s Bethany Cosentino—no stranger to criticisms about elementary-school lyricism and stunted relationship dynamics—lends guest vocals to “Go Away”, which is a decent song but an even more important pledge of allegiance.
Heck, even the confounding decisions and filler that inextricably form latter-day Weezer albums are kinda charming. The whistle-core of “Da Vinci” will probably be the only way you’ll remember that Foster the People made a record this year. Meanwhile, the closing, mostly instrumental “The Futurescope Trilogy” probably belongs on Cuomo's unreleased space odyssey Songs From the Black Hole and doesn’t stack up to “The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)”, the batshit piece of musical theater that proved Cuomo can set new positive benchmarks for himself in the 21st century.
Everything Will Be Alright in the End doesn’t set a new benchmark for Weezer, but hopefully it can go lengths to ridding them of the ridiculously unfair catch-22 they’ve faced. The past couple of weeks have seen a surprise Thom Yorke album dropped on BitTorrent, the first Aphex Twin record since 2001, and a lavish reissue of Smashing Pumpkins’ Adore, and almost none of them were subject to the kind of truly wacked-out, incomprehensible standards given to Weezer’s ninth album. Granted, Rivers Cuomo hasn’t done himself many favors, as his music has been marked by refusal to evolve in the slightest either emotionally or sonically. Even still, why couldn’t Cuomo just do this in peace? Because even though Weezer and Pinkerton were never embraced by critics in real time, they sure seem to have been embraced by a lot of people who grew up to be critics, who in turn have relished every opportunity to bash Weezer albums as a way of separating themselves from an embarrassing part of their lives where the perspective of “No One Else” and “Pink Triangle” felt like the truth.
There have been many ways to qualify praise for Weezer and with each successive listen, Everything Will Be Alright in the End certainly earns the typically backhanded compliments: “actually not terrible,” “certainly better than Hurley,” “probably their best since...Maladroit, that was good right?” Or, Everything could be accepted for what it is and be held to a more manageable standard: how good does a Weezer album have to be before it can be considered actually good?  As it turns out, about this good.

Pinkerton [Deluxe Edition] / Death to False Metal,Weezer,2010,10.0,"Weezer's overlooked second album eventually became a cult favorite and now it's received a deluxe 2xCD reissue; there's also this other new record...
","At one point, there seemed as strong a chance of Weezer's making an album as good as Pinkerton as there was of their reissuing it. To say nothing of playing it live in its entirety. It's hard to think of a more fiercely beloved record a band has gone to great lengths to write out of its history. To recap: Weezer's self-titled Blue Album went multiplatinum on the strength of shiny power-pop and goofy videos anachronistic in the era of post-grunge. For the follow-up, Rivers Cuomo holed up at Harvard and made a disturbingly graphic, harshly recorded concept album that includes his sniffing the fanmail of an 18-year old Japanese girl while imagining her masturbating. Needless to say, it was not played for laughs. Pinkerton was poorly received by critics upon release and considered a flop after peaking at #19. Cuomo probably didn't care about the critics, but he took the public indifference very personally, soon retreating from view. But the cult that adored and passionately identified with Pinkerton became hard to ignore by the turn of the century, with the commercial breakthrough of confessional emo seen as its ultimate vindication. The record that killed Weezer's career ended up saving it.
It's a nice story, and one that's integral and damn near necessary to protect Pinkerton's legend: a popular misconception is that a Rolling Stone readers' poll named it the worst album of 1996 (it was actually third behind Bush and DJ Spooky), and as Rob Mitchum suggested in his review of Make Believe, it's something that people of a certain age might protect from re-evaluation for what it might say about their youth. In actuality, Pinkerton may initially have been the victim of a generation gap. It was hardly the first album to get this uncomfortably confessional, but it had some unusually bad timing. Self-laceration was in vogue during 1996, but as far as critical favorites went, it was often from a female perspective (Liz Phair, PJ Harvey, Courtney Love) that balanced boldness and raw vulnerability. In comparison, Pinkerton was hardly misunderstood, but instead seen for what it was: written from a juvenile, male, and incredibly needy perspective. It's a really tough album to go to bat for if you're an adult, particularly since enjoying it is so closely associated with relating to it.
And who would want to do that? On the very first song, Cuomo is Portnoy's Complaint on wax, disappointed with his inability to find true love in the midst of meaningless sex. And on the last one, he forsakes a chance at true love for... you guessed it, meaningless sex, giving an explanation that drips with insincerity: ""I did what my body told me to/ I didn't mean to do you harm."" In between, he lashes out at a woman for having the nerve to be a lesbian (""Pink Triangle"") and for not devoting all of her attention to him (""No Other One""). He takes two failed relationships as concrete proof of romantic futility in ""Why Bother?"", and of course, the big reveal in ""Across the Sea"": ""It's all your fault, mama.""
And yet because of all of this emotional baggage, the cathartic power of Pinkerton is second to none. While it's often compared to the Blue Album, Pinkerton bears more similarity to In Utero, a record that also mixed relatively raw alt-rock production, undeniable pop smarts, and a lead singer absolutely freaked the fuck out by fame. But while many sickeningly thought Kurt Cobain's suicide somehow validated his art, Cuomo's self-destruction was more quotidian and relatable, struggling with an unbearable need to be loved but a complete inability to realize the need for it to be reciprocated. It's why Pinkerton isn't misogynistic so much as confused: ""No Other One"" classically mistakes hating yourself for loving someone else, and ""El Scorcho"" reminds that fictional RomCom behavior is actually borderline sociopathic in real life. In fact, the songs most likened to cuddly Blue Album Weezer are the darkest-- ""The Good Life"" is Cuomo at the end of his rope, hysterical at the ridiculousness of his self-loathing, while a single line in ""El Scorcho"" sums up the core of Pinkerton's pain: ""I can't talk about it/ I gotta sing about it and make a record.""
The influence of Pinkerton led to hundreds of mostly regrettable bands, but what ultimately distinguishes Weezer is how they sonically mirror the unhinged and private mental terror of its narrator. Weezer actually sound dangerous here in places, in part due to the recording of Dave Fridmann, who maintains a first-take intimacy even when every instrument competes to be the loudest thing in the mix. Weezer's rhythm section rarely gets much credit, but Matt Sharp and Pat Wilson maintain a savage low-end they'd never repeat-- the coda of ""Tired of Sex"" embodies overwhelming and impotent frustration, while the chorus of ""Getchoo"" isn't a hook, it's a fist repeatedly hitting a wall.
The supposedly juvenile feelings of Pinkerton still pack visceral power years after listeners would've supposedly outgrown them. It's a record that reaches well beyond a diaristic look at Cuomo's perversions, and instead asks something more universal: Do we really grow out of our teenage feelings, or do we need something like Pinkerton to expose them as merely being repressed to the point where they mutate? It's heavy stuff, and in the manner of Violent Femmes, you can argue about the sexual politics, the late-career parody, or the total uncoolness of it in retrospect, but even if Pinkerton is ultimately an album that gets one single shot at you, the mark it leaves is indelible.
Befitting a band for the diehards, Weezer's always had certain B-sides that are every bit as loved as the singles. Though this deluxe version contains 25 extra tracks, 16 are alternate versions of material that appeared on Pinkerton: If you need muddy-sounding live versions of ""Why Bother?"" and ""Pink Triangle"", or if ""Across the Sea Piano Noodles"" triggers an uncontrollable completist impulse, consider it an early Christmas. Me, I'm here for their acoustic performances of ""El Scorcho"" and ""The Good Life"" at Y100, the erstwhile alt-rock station I listened to in high school. Otherwise, most of the unreleased B-sides are demo-level in both sound and quality.
The more intriguing prospect is Death to False Metal, proudly touted as ""Weezer's third release of the fourth quarter."" Not really sticking to any concrete organizational principle, Weezer cull unreleased material dating back to the late 90s from a wide range of sources, including their own fans and Toni Braxton. But as a clearinghouse for an increasingly prolific band, False Metal isn't particularly generous. In fact, judging from its wacky title/cover combo, 10-song tracklist, and overall quality, it dubiously achieves Cuomo's stated goal of creating the logical follow-up to Hurley.
The power pop Weezer work with maintains its devotees in large part because of its adherence to a kind of strict formula, and having mastered it early in his career, Cuomo can churn it out effortlessly, for better or (mostly) worse. Verses are treated with merely custodial concern before the big hooks, there's the guitar solos that are flashy enough to be noticed but easy enough to learn, and the production glosses everything up to radio-ready ubiquity and anonymity. But once again, there's a laziness that's more annoying than any of Cuomo's ""cool dad"" humor. There's the song about turning up the radio, and it's called ""Turning Up the Radio""-- the irony of its being the result of a YouTube contest is actually kinda fascinating. Cuomo's shown an almost frightening ability to tap into a certain generic teenage frustration, and ""Losing My Mind"" is the song to which you can grouse about your allowance.
Upon reviewing Hurley, I said that Weezer's songs feel more like single-packed sitcoms now, but nothing on that album can match ""The Odd Couple"", which boasts the sort of hack-joke opening line (""I got a PC, you got a Mac"") that Fountains of Wayne wouldn't touch*.* ""Blowin' My Stack"" and ""I'm a Robot"" are the working-for-the-weekend anthems, and that both have blatantly similar lyrics (""I need cash to pay my bills"" / ""I have to earn money to pay my bills"") suggests a general lack of curatorial oversight to False Metal.
At the very least, there's a sense of closure in the simultaneous release of Pinkerton and Death to False Metal: For the past decade, new Weezer albums have been unfavorably judged relative to Pinkerton, and hey, we finally get to do it in real time. But there's always been an underlying unease that, at least in more indie-leaning circles, we're becoming every bit as susceptible to the generation gap that led to the dismissal of Pinkerton in the first place. Even if Weezer were able to come up with something as potent as Pinkerton, would we recognize it?
I suppose that doesn't give the listener enough credit, but we can do away with the idea that Pinkerton is somehow ""realer"" than other Weezer records. Even if they're more Spike Jones than Spike Jonze these days, it exists on the same continuum as Raditude, Hurley, and yes, even Make Believe-- Cuomo's work has always been driven by a need for approval, and once the Green Album was seemingly spawned by popular demand, he's used his band as an embodiment of that. That their ""Memories Tour"" is financially backed by AXE appears terribly ironic, but in reality, Weezer are also a brand that realizes striking a chord with boys obsessed with sex gives you a license to print money. By the same token, it gives me comfort that Pinkerton will remain timeless-- its fanbase is the ultimate renewable resource.

Weezer (Green Album),Weezer,2001,4.0,"I could fill an entire paragraph right now simply repeating the name Weezer. Oh, Weezer, Weezer, Weezer. Oh, Weezer. How ...
","I could fill an entire paragraph right now simply repeating the name Weezer. Oh, Weezer, Weezer, Weezer. Oh, Weezer. How sad I am for Weezer. Let's backtrack. This requires a lot of personal history to be revealed-- total stream-of-consciousness memory recall. We'll start in 1994. In 1994, I was ten years old. Rock music was a new and relatively unknown concept to me. By rock music, I mean rock music: distorted guitars, hard-hitting drums, the harshness of grunge and rock. It had already broken onto mainstream radio, but I was too young to pay attention. I was a weird kid, busying myself with Talking Heads and Laurie Anderson records.
The girl who lived next door (and who also happened to take care of me on occasion, when my parents were out) was probably around 12 or 13 at the time. I thought she was beautiful. It resembled a crush, although it probably wasn't. And occasionally, we would listen to CDs. She brought over her very small collection-- mine was already three times as large. There was a blue disc amongst her discs. She pulled it out and pressed play. My world was blasted apart. She clearly loved this, and I had no idea what to think. ""Undone (The Sweater Song)"" was her favorite. It was one of those rare 'brand new' experiences I'm lucky enough to be able to remember. Not long after, I obtained a copy of my own. It was my favorite album for a very long time. I ordered lyrics from the fan club through the mail. I memorized the handwritten words while listening to the album on repeat. ""My Name is Jonas"" was pure beauty, and ""Only in Dreams"" was pure power. It still is.
Somehow, I didn't manage to pick up Pinkerton until 1999. I'd kind of forgotten about Weezer for a year or two, and then suddenly I remembered them. At first, I wasn't terribly impressed, clearly being more familiar with the sound of grunge and angst. And then I listened to it a second time and was knocked out all over again. I went back to ""the blue album,"" this time understanding the intricacies of the sound-- what makes the songs so warm and effective. Its simple brilliance slapped me; it sounded as fresh as it did the first time I ever heard it. So naturally, as news of Weezer recording began to circulate late last year, I was overjoyed. How would they follow-up the blistering, angry Pinkerton?
And then, months later, Weezer released ""Hash Pipe."" It was on the radio one day a few weeks ago. I listened to it. I listened to the whole song, from beginning to end. And when it ended, I said no. I said no no no no no. No! Weezer! NO!! Where has Rivers Cuomo gone? What has he done? What has happened to Weezer?! WHERE ARE THE REAL WEEZER?!! My heart was broken. Really. This is going to sound like hyperbole, but I hated music at that moment. For just a moment, I lost faith completely. It was an overblown reaction, granted, but even after I realized how ridiculous I was being, I still felt a hatred. The song was abysmal, no two ways about it. It wasn't awkward. It wasn't charming. It didn't have dueling guitar solos with soaring and intricate harmonies. And what it wasn't made it what it was: stale, polished, emotionless.
The new self-titled Weezer album, as it turns out, is average from beginning to end. There are maybe one or two decent melodies out of the ten songs here, and the only change in tone comes with ""Island in the Sun,"" the album's only truly enjoyable song and its catchiest hook. It's the first and only moment of even moderate pleasure in the record's brief yet far too long 28-minute length. But even with this singular change in volume and mood, Weezer lacks the sense of dynamics and intricacy that Pinkerton-- and especially their debut-- held in spades. There's no power to these songs, and even less depth.
It's a de-evolution back through Pinkerton, through the blue album, and beyond. Like ""Hash Pipe,"" it doesn't seem genuine anymore. But The Green Album doesn't generally sound like the canned, artificial angst of ""Hash Pipe""; it has a sunny disposition, with songs like ""O Girlfriend"" and ""Glorious Day."" An actual line from the song ""Smile,"" for instance: ""Open up your heart and let the good stuff come out."" It's unoriginal, moronic and tacky, and that's all there is to it. Nothing under the surface. Disappointment.
I was bitter. At Rivers, at Weezer, at Geffen and Interscope. This was one of my favorite bands. They were the only band whose fan club I have ever joined. They had significance. They opened musical doors for me. This album is not that Weezer. But I had to write a review, so I did a little research. And I read that, after the complete failure of the angst and emotional extremes of Pinkerton in the music world, Cuomo felt as if his goal to be a rockstar was completely obliterated. So he locked himself in his room for a year, with no outside contact, and when he came out, his work suddenly had no emotional content.
He's now afraid that fans of the band will hate the new album and lose touch with him and the group. He genuinely realizes that all of the feeling in his vocals and lyrics are gone, and he realizes that it's probably a phase. And I suddenly share his fear. So maybe the real Weezer-- the Weezer I know and love-- can come back now. After this phase ends and the album goes platinum, maybe they'll feel better about themselves. I'm going to go upstairs now to listen to the album that is 1994 to me, the album that is still new and marvelous to me after seven years, and fall asleep content.

Hurley,Weezer,2010,5.0,"Weezer return to basics on their eighth album, and first for Epitaph Records.
","Hurley is Weezer's first record for Epitaph, a partnership that makes a ton of sense since that label has long been the province of smart-alecky teens who like skateboarding and jacked-up power-pop. And it's doubly fitting because Weezer are getting back to basics here after a few years recording with Lil Wayne and letting the other band members sing. Indeed, there is something of a noticeable ""return to form"" about Hurley-- their best album since at least, uh, Maladroit. The first single, ""Memories"", is actually about older Weezer-- sure, the lyrics are sub-Ben Folds nyuks (""playin' hacky sack back when Audioslave was still Rage"") and the X Games-style brass fanfare can be a turnoff, but as with 2008 single ""Pork and Beans"", the autobiographical framework of it gives it a certain charm.
Nobody is going to confuse this with 1990s Weezer-- there are still plenty of oddball collaborations (Michael Cera, Linda Perry) for one thing-- but the lows aren't as low or as frequent as they were in recent years. This is still a Mk. III Weezer album where songs are constructed more like sitcoms: each has a single premise based on a rigid structure and a comforting predictability, and each can be experienced in virtually any order. The listenability is at its lowest when it sounds like the producer was meant to pipe in a laugh track. ""Where's My Sex?"" is pretty much D.O.A., and Cuomo doesn't do much to revive it, the ""big reveal"" being the phonic similarities between ""sex"" and ""socks"" (""I can't go out without my sex/ It's cold outside and my toes get wet""). ""Smart Girls"" is laughably half-assed, which is more than I can say about lyrics that lack so badly for any sort of detail that you could simply replace ""Smart"" in the title with ""Dumb"" or any other adjective.
It's a shame Hurley is so dependant on such lyrical hijinks, because the one thing Cuomo's never abandoned is a ruthlessly economical approach to songwriting. When Hurley works, it's because Cuomo is a master of form. Even if you're not going to be the one singing along, it's easy to imagine ""Ruling Me"" offering some sort of platonic radio-rock pleasure, while ""Hang On"" positions itself as the one where the kids will be waving their iPhones in the air. But when the two instincts clash on ""Trainwrecks"", you hear a perfectly anthemic chorus get lost in a confused verse where Cuomo doesn't put in enough effort to indicate whether it's a riff on hipsters or on himself.
Which leads to the question that's accompanied pretty much everything Weezer's done since The Green Album: Is this a bad album on its own terms, a rush job that could have worked better were the band not releasing records at this pace? Or was Weezer always a goofy pop band subjected to indie ideals they never believed in? The answers depend more on the listener than anyone else. You can't deny that Cuomo feels no shame and is making exactly the kind of music he wants, and there's ultimately something disarming about that.

Raditude,Weezer,2009,4.5,"Melodic sing-alongs, fuzz-guitar riffs-- Weezer are going back to basics, making music that sounds for (but also often by) 13-year-olds.
","Right now, psychiatrists are feverishly debating over what to include in the next revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: the DSM-V, the psych bible. Among the syndromes those experts may decide whether to include in the latest edition is Peter Pan Syndrome, adults who long for youth so powerfully they begin to act like eternal children. Think Michael Jackson, who in naming his ranch Neverland, certainly invited the diagnosis.
But most people with Peter Pan Syndrome regress to pre-pubertal life, an age before the complications of responsibility and sexuality. So what do we call what Rivers Cuomo has? The Weezer frontman seems to be stuck in an eternal puberty, forever 13-- confused, horny, hyperbolic, obsessed with brand names. It's a characteristic that has always been at the heart of Weezer, from ""In the Garage"" onward. But it's never been more concentrated than on Raditude, which, from its goofy name and cover art to its Mountain Dew-jacked sound and melodramatic lyrics, is designed to hit 13-year-old boys directly on target.
And Cuomo is damned good at getting inside the frightening mind of a teenage boy. ""(If You're Wondering If I Want You To) I Want You To"" is a perfect title for a song about awkward courtship, and the fact that the narrator takes his date to Best Buy (teenage Mecca) before a home viewing of Titanic is pinpoint detail. Echoes of ""In the Garage"" turn up in, well, ""In the Mall"", written by drummer Patrick Wilson but sold by Cuomo emphatically chronicling the cruising circuit of elevator-to-escalator-to-elevator. Elsewhere on Raditude, Cuomo whines about going to work, pressures girls into third base, parrots hip-hop slang, escapes into ridiculous fantasy, and on bonus track ""Get Me Some"" portrays the teenage experience in four words: ""Right now/ Everything sucks.""
Of course, these journal scrawls are backed largely by power-pop-- what else could it be? Cuomo proved for all time with the first two Weezer records (and fleetingly since) that he's a master of the genre, popping out melodic sing-alongs and fuzz-guitar riffs, and Raditude largely goes back to those basics. ""Let It All Hang Out"" is a song about celebrating the weekend and forgetting your troubles and sounds like the song you would play to do exactly that. The peppy (if a bit on the creepy side) ""I'm Your Daddy"", made with Britney and Miley collaborator Dr. Luke, justly turns the table on rock-borrowing pop like ""Since U Been Gone"". All together, it sounds like the first record ever written with the goal expressly in mind of being kick-ass to play on Rock Band. The departures from that formula are harder to stomach, particularly the Bollywood-drenched Hallmark card ""Love Is the Answer"", which is absolutely awful.
I still get hate mail for saying Make Believe was so bad that it retroactively ruined the Blue Album and Pinkerton, and I still believe it-- ""Beverly Hills"" was the sound of a band that had learned to do as little as possible to write a hit. But Raditude doesn't have that stench of minimal calculation on it; if anything, it's as earnest as the famously confessional Pinkerton, just written by someone whose age doesn't match his POV. But the record's teen-boy empowerment message doesn't have much to offer anyone over 13 years old. Perhaps the proper fictional character to reference isn't Peter Pan, but Matthew McConaughey's Wooderson from Dazed and Confused-- we all get older, Rivers Cuomo stays the same age.

Everything Under the Sun,The Walker Brothers,2006,7.7,"From melodrama to MOR to a few stabs at metal machine music, this 5xCD box collects the entire recorded works of the Scott Walker-led group's anachronistic career.
","Feeling out a central arc in the story of the Walker Brothers is tough-- it's a story that goes in fits and starts and doesn't stay on one path for long. Their three members weren't named Walker, and they weren't brothers. They were American, but hit it big after moving to swinging London and subsequently becoming a part of the British Invasion. They made their most challenging music three albums into a completely unexpected mid-1970s reunion. They're sometimes viewed as an anachronism in the London of Carnaby Street, UFO, Indica Books, and the International Times, and yet at the time they sold records by the boatload.
There's some truth to the anachronism view-- I keep trying to picture them touring with Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, and the Soft Machine, but the image won't come. There's something about their intensely dramatic (sometimes melodramatic) music, orchestral formalism, and triple-threat heartthrob image that just doesn't jibe with beat and psychedelia. Perhaps that's why their music largely avoids sounding dated to its 1965-1967 time frame. That's not to say it sounds modern, either-- very few artists make records like this anymore-- but it's certainly not tied up with 60s counter-culture associations.
Covering more than 100 tracks (13 previously unissued) over five discs, Everything Under the Sun is true to its name, bringing together all of the Walkers' material, from Scott's early, awkward exhortations to ""do the jerk"" to his first forays into bizarro world on 1978's Nite Flights LP. If nothing else, this proves that their music is more than just hors d'oeuvre for Scott Walker's solo career. There are throwaway tracks all over the place, sure, but there are small masterpieces as well, and there's immense talent on display nearly everywhere.
Scott Engel, John Maus, and Gary Leeds originally came together in L.A., where all three had been session players since the early 60s. In early, pre-Leeds bands with Maus, Engel mostly wanted to play bass and barely sang at all. Early sessions with Jack Nietzsche at the boards changed that-- Engel's voice was simply too spectacular to keep hidden. That voice-- so rich and sonorous, naturally stuffed with gravitas-- is in the lead on most of the songs on this box, and it's obvious why.
The Walkers' material splits neatly into two phases, each with three albums: the original 60s act and the 70s reunion. Singles and B-sides throw the balance of material to the 60s, and it's interesting to hear them hit and miss in the early going. Their take on Bacharach/David's ""Make It Easy on Yourself"" is the height of majesty in pop music, with Ivor Raymonde's swirling string arrangement and Scott's soaring lead vocal. But it's surrounded by lousy versions of ""Dancing in the Street"" and ""Land of 1,000 Dances"" (who didn't play that song in 1965?), and the amusing Engel-penned ""Do the Jerk"", a song that's light years from the literary ballads he'd one day make his stock in trade.
At this point, all three Walkers were ravenous for stardom, but it didn't take too many chaotic shows or invasions of privacy for Scott to tire of being a pop icon. ""The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore"", which appears here in three slightly different versions, was their supernova moment, grabbing the UK #1 spot for four straight weeks, and after that it was simply a matter of time before the split, though it thankfully wouldn't come for two more years. The group's second album, 1966's Portrait, is excellent and surprisingly dark. ""In My Room"" opens it with a blast of apocalyptic trumpet, while ""Hurting Each Other"" nearly equals the drama of ""The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore.""
""Saturday's Child"" and Engel's ""Living Above Your Head"" are charged forays into rock, but it's on two non-album tracks that Scott really flexes his muse. ""Archangel"" is ominous, with blaring, almost abrasive church organ, while ""Mrs. Murphy"", not coincidentally from the Solo John Solo Scott EP, anticipates the vivid character studies like ""Big Louise"" that littered his first five solo albums. Their third album, Images, teeters between beautiful, jazz-inflected orchestral ballads like the Scott-sung ""Once Upon a Summertime"" and borderline schmaltz, like the Scott-written Tex-Mex tune ""Experience"". ""Orpheus"" sounds like it would have fit on Scott, though, and Maus' ""I Wanna Know"" even makes a half-stab into fuzz-rock territory with some success.
And that was it for the Walker Brothers, or so it seemed. Discs four and five in this set pick up the thread in the mid-70s, when the band quite spontaneously reunited (Leeds simply called Engel one day and asked if he'd be up for getting back together). Though they experienced a bit of chart success early in the reunion, this remains a fairly unknown musical chapter, coming as it did after Scott's initial burst of solo creativity had waned and the other two had been far from the public eye for years. The first two albums, 1975's No Regrets and 1976's Lines, basically update the band's 60s aesthetic for the 70s-- dryer sound, more subdued orchestration, guitar solos, a generally smoother feel, and even a little reggae influence, of all things.
Those first two reunion records consist entirely of covers, and while they have their moments-especially the title track of No Regrets, a Tom Rush cover, and the r&b-soaked take on ""Burn our Bridges""-- they don't sound especially inspired either, often static, blandly rocking or, at worst, cloying and treacly. It's the last eleven tracks on this set, comprising the album Nite Flights and the cast-off instrumental ""Tokyo Rimshot"" that redeem the group's second phase. These songs-- two written by Leeds, four by Maus and five by Engel-- are post-punk in all but name, and Engel's are downright shocking, as far away on the pop spectrum from the simpering of ""Lovers"" and the generic rock of ""First Day"" and ""Have You Seen My Baby"" as possible.
""Death of Romance"" makes it sound like Leeds had been listening to a lot of Roxy Music, while his ""Den Haague"" ads weird microtonal percussion to its skinny-tie funk. Maus' songs work in similar prog-funk territory, but the work of both men feels firmly rooted to the 70s, where Engel's songs sound like they come from a parallel universe, firmly pointing the way toward Climate of Hunter, Tilt and the Drift. ""Shutout"" is mind-scorching avant-disco topped with a counter-intuitively catchy vocal and wickedly amelodic guitar. I can't imagine being a fan of ""No Regrets"" and getting kicked four-square in the face with the sour robo-funk of ""Fat Mama Kick"", much less ""The Electrician"" a harrowing, dissonant six-minute journey into the part of Scott Engel's brain that keeps him up nights, interrupted by a lush orchestral explosion. This was Scott Walker emerging completely from his shell, never to return.
That the Walker Brothers should go out on such an unexpectedly cutting-edge note hardly seems out of place given their history as a whole. If there's a real arc to their story, it's probably that they were never fully in step with what was happening around them, but made it work for them. This box tells the whole story in music, and includes a generously illustrated book that nevertheless focuses on the Walkers together, leaving out the portions of the story that happened before, after and in between their two stints together. All of the No Regrets and Lines albums might be a little too much to own for the average person, but this is a great all-in-one-place collection for big fans of the brothers and solo Scott as well.

Urban Hymns,The Verve,1997,8.6,"The Verve’s blockbuster third album—newly reissued in a five-disc expanded edition—has come to be seen as the swan song for Britpop’s cultural hegemony. But in 1997, it felt like a step forward.
","By 1997, Britpop’s clashing titans were diverging in sharply different directions—Blur with the discordant experimentalism of their self-titled album, Oasis with the overblown and obvious Be Here Now. That opened up a big lane for Wigan, UK misfits the Verve to swoop in and conquer the nation with their blockbuster third album, Urban Hymns—a record that has come to be seen as the swan song for Britpop’s cultural hegemony, but at the time suggested an intriguing next stage in its evolution. It boasted all the anthemic grandeur of Oasis at their Wembley-baiting best while spinning away from Britpop’s traditional 1960s rock/1970s punk axis for a greater emphasis on lush atmosphere and deep groove. As such, it was the rare Britpop album that could be embraced by those who were turned off by—or had outgrown—the genre’s unabashedly retro indulgences and two-fingers-aloft, cigarettes ‘n’ alcohol hooliganism.
But even when they were on top of the world, the Verve were always on shaky ground. Urban Hymns was the surprise third act for a band that seemed doomed after its second. Their most successful single up to that point—1995’s string-swept ballad “History”—doubled as an epitaph, with the notoriously embattled relationship between frontman Richard Ashcroft and guitarist Nick McCabe triggering the band’s demise just before it snuck into the UK Top 30. Ashcroft, bassist Simon Jones, and drummer Pete Salisbury would swiftly reconvene with a new guitarist (their old school chum Simon Tong) to begin work on a record that, for a time, seemed destined to become an Ashcroft solo release. But the singer quickly realized his vision would be incomplete without McCabe’s six-string sorcery, and after inviting his old foil back into the fold and reformulating the group as a five-piece, the Verve’s comeback narrative was in motion.
However, even with McCabe back at Ashcroft’s side, his hallucinatory guitar squall would prove less of a defining feature. On the Verve’s first two records, McCabe was the engine that rocketed the band to the stratosphere—but on Urban Hymns, the Verve achieve their heady cruising altitude on a cloud-bed of cosmic funk grooves, hip-hop-schooled beat science, and elegant orchestration. Where, in their early days, an ominous ambient piece like “Neon Wilderness” might get stretched out to a 10-minute excursion, on Urban Hymns it functions as a brief, sides-bridging interlude, a foggy flashback to the band they once were. Strobe-lit, wah-wah-splattered jams like “The Rolling People” were now the exceptions rather than the rule.
McCabe’s presence is barely perceptible on the album’s crowning achievement, “Bitter Sweet Symphony,” a glistening, swan-ice-sculpture of a song that injected Britpop with a healthy dose of boom-bap. (Alas, this monster hit wholly lived up to its name when the band was forced to fork over the royalties from their biggest hit to the Rolling Stones and their iron-fisted rights-holder Allen Klein for sampling an orchestral version of “The Last Time” without the proper clearance.) Urban Hymns’ other towering peaks—celestial, lighter-waving sing-alongs like “The Drugs Don’t Work,” “Sonnet,” and “Lucky Man”—likewise use windswept strings and tasteful ambient shading to fill in the space where McCabe’s heavenly storms used to rage.
At the time, Ashcroft was still fueled by enough underdog insolence and the maniacal self-belief that he could make even those soft-rock songs hit hard. Equal parts boho Bono and Jagger swagger, he wasn’t merely content to earn song dedications from Noel Gallagher, he wanted to overtake him at the top of the charts. At the same time, as “The Drugs Don’t Work” unsubtly suggested, he was eager to put his Mad Richard reputation to bed—and for much of Urban Hymns, he sounds less like the barefoot shaman of old and more like someone easing into a pair of slippers.
In the wake of possibly the only British space-rock soap opera in history, Ashcroft had married Spiritualized keyboardist Kate Radley in 1995, and in stark contrast to the psych-jazz meltdowns her ex-boyfriend/bandmate Jason Pierce unleashed on his own 1997 opus, Ladies and Gentleman We Are Floating in Space, the prevailing mood on Urban Hymns is one of sunrise-summoning renewal. The album’s second half is mostly given over to clear-eyed statements of devotion like “Space and Time,” “One Day,” and “Velvet Morning”—the relaxed, contented sound of Britpop entering middle age (the net result of which was a slew of younger bands—Coldplay, Starsailor, et al—who would emerge already sounding like genteel old men). Even when the Verve momentarily revisit their primordial roar on the closing “Come On,” with Ashcroft screaming “fuck you” to no one and everyone, it’s ultimately an expression of joy rather than psychosis.
As this five-disc expanded edition reveals, Urban Hymns could’ve easily wound up an even mellower record. The sessions yielded enough material to fill another album, and for the most part, the Verve made the right calls to hold it back. Many of the Urban Hymns holdovers are less compelling versions of the songs that made the final tracklist: acoustic ballad “So Sister” is “The Drugs Don’t Work” without the dark-night-of-the-soul reckoning; “Echo Bass” and “Three Steps” are medium-heat psych-funk workouts that never reach the roiling boil of “The Rolling People.” (Notable exceptions include “Never Wanna See You Cry,” which makes for a fine “Sonnet II,” and the nocturnal voodoo soul of “Monte Carlo.”) And then there’s the slick, celebratory folk-rock of “This Could Be My Moment,” which even in light of Urban Hymns’ sunnier disposition, represents a swerve into MOR too far.
But if those outtakes present the Verve at their most pedestrian, the wealth of bonus live material here serves to restore some of their formative mysticism. Urban Hymns represented millions of people’s first contact with the Verve, and the band used live appearances to bring the newbies up to speed on their previous travels—like on a 1997 BBC Evening Session where they dip into moody, mercurial versions of A Northern Soul’s “Life’s an Ocean” and ’92 debut-EP cut “A Man Called Sun.” And while including the band’s entire May 1998 set at Wigan’s Haigh Hall (i.e., The Verve’s own Oasis-at-Knebworth moment) plus a whole ’nother disc worth of random live tracks from the era may seem like overkill, the recordings capture a band committed to elevating concerts to holy communions, no matter the venue. Even when the Verve were playing to a thousand or so people at Washington D.C.’s 9:30 Club shortly after Hymns’ release, they were already envisioning the 30,000-plus that would greet them a half-year later in their hometown.
For all the inter- and intra-band drama that fueled its creation, Urban Hymns ultimately centered around a very basic, universal theme: live for the moment and give it all you got, because we’ve only got one shot at this thing called life. It’s a sentiment that would seem terribly cornball and clichéd—if the Verve’s subsequent history didn’t so thoroughly reinforce its veracity. Less than a month after their Haigh Hall coronation, a disgruntled McCabe left the band once again, prior to a North American summer arena tour. What should’ve been a victory lap instead became a funeral procession, with Ashcroft and co. dutifully going through the motions alongside a session-player replacement before calling it a day once again. Of course, as the lyrics to “Bitter Sweet Symphony” attested, the Verve had at that point become well accustomed to life’s cruel twists and unforgiving ironies. Like the resuscitated heart-attack victim who had cheated death once, this was a band that knew it was living on borrowed time. But this collection is a testament to what can happen when you make the most of it.

Forth,The Verve,2008,5.0,"The second Verve reunion album, released 11 years after the last one, finds them still trying to be the biggest band in the world-- and still failing.
","Despite the fact that Verve singer Richard Ashcroft and guitarist Nick McCabe share a mutual regard that's more Sting and Stewart Copeland than Hall and Oates, or that it's been nearly a decade since the Wigan-based group was last functional, their reunion was a pretty easy call. You could take the succession of cheese-scented flops known as ""Richard Ashcroft solo albums"" as evidence. You might also see the appeal of being a British band that makes epic-sounding symphonic pop at a time when Coldplay are basically the biggest rock band in the world. Really, though, the reason is more elemental-- something everyone from Jay-Z to the Spice Girls knows is true: No self-made messiah can exist without a resurrection.
Of the top-tier Britpop-era heavyweights, Oasis catch the most flak for delusions of grandeur, but all they ever really wanted was for people to sing along in adoration: It's hard to imagine Noel Gallagher writing a song for any reason other than single-minded devotion to 1) hugeness, or 2) the chorus. Ashcroft wants you to sing along, too, sure-- but he also wants to heal, soothe, and illuminate. What else could the parting skies and emergent God rays on Forth's cover mean but that He hath returned?
To be fair, musically speaking, about half of Forth is as good as the band's commercial breakthrough, Urban Hymns-- and, if you consider the general hit/miss ratio of decade-removed comeback albums, that's actually a pretty respectable showing. It also helps to explain why at least some of the British press have met this new record with typically effusive praise: the soft bigotry of low expectations. (Granted, the Verve's two earlier records were actually a lot more interesting than Urban Hymns, but that's ancient history now.)
The most useful thing about Forth is the mirror it reflects back on us now. In 1997, this kind of thing-- crisp, echoing guitars, provincial strings, existential moodiness-- actually sounded kind of exciting. Just over a decade later, though, the exact same recipe, prepared exactly the same way, conjures up new dominant aftertastes: false profundity, compositional laziness, and outsized egos. What changed? Is it just that we now have better access to more and wider varieties of music? Is monoculture dead? Are big-label bands with these sorts of impulses the dinosaur rockers of the 00s?
Maybe it's just that Forth seems so telegraphed and formulaic that its most awful moments, like the watered-down space-rock of the seriously appalling ""Judas"" (sample lyric: ""New York, I was Judas/ She said a latte double shot for Judas"") or the toothless blues jamming on the interminable ""Noise Epic"" (on which Ashcroft, uhh, raps), end up weighing heavier than the album's highlights. Those hoping to find the Verve in full-on cloud-parting mode may be able to plug comfortably into songs like ""Sit and Wonder"", ""Rather Be"", ""I See Houses"", and ""Valium Skies"", but even these tracks feel simply like safe, calculated throwback exercises. Ashcroft wants this to be his holy hour, but to many of us, it'll sound a lot longer than that.

This Is Music: The Singles 92-98,The Verve,2004,8.3,"Career-spanning compilation that moves from post-shoegaze neo-pscyhedelica to Britpop-era heroics.
","He may be better known for his anthems, his ego, and his excess, but Richard Ashcroft also tells a good story. And as the new career-spanning compilation This Is Music: The Singles 92-98 reveals, the history of his band, The Verve, is a good story as well. They began by playing sprawling, kaleidoscopic, heavens-scraping jams. These 60s-style improvisatory mindfucks were then edited down into the slightly less sprawling tracks that comprise the group's 1993 debut, A Storm in Heaven, an intoxicating amalgam of psychedelica and shoegaze.
Then Verve became The Verve (jazz 1, rock 0) and started to discipline their diaphanous noisescapes with traditional British songcraft. They released an ecstasy-laden promise of even better things to come, 1995's A Northern Soul. Ashcroft earned praise in song from the biggest band in Britain, Oasis. And then the band broke up.
But Ashcroft, the story's iconic hero as well as its raconteur, had prophesied that his band would secure a place in the rock'n'roll firmament. And lo, it was so: The band reformed, and 1997's decade-defining Urban Hymns almost made up for the then-recent demise of Britpop.
Sure, Ashcroft went on to release solo albums littered with self-indulgent drivel, and masterful guitarist Nick McCabe has been uncharacteristically quiet. Meanwhile, bassist Simon Jones and drummer Peter Salisbury's royalty checks sure aren't writing themselves! (Late addition Simon Tong? He found a gig as Blur's new Graham Coxon.) That just means it's time for the next phase of the story: The singles compilation, complete with ""new"" tracks. If The Verve's tale is Ashcroft's epic, This Is Music is his short-stories anthology.
Here's where the narrative starts to fall apart. The disc doesn't follow any recognizable order. So if newcomers want a quick taste of the early Verve's vast, submarine jamming, they'll have to skip to tracks five and eleven, respectively, to hear rare-ish singles ""She's a Superstar"" and ""Gravity Grave."" The conch-shaped guitar lines of first single ""All in the Mind"" announce the group's arrival to the world on track nine. The Ride-like shimmer of ""Slide Away"" (track two) and the droning anthemics of ""Blue"" (track seven) represent the debut full-length admirably, though a little context would be nice.
On the other hand, the sophomore album's ""This Is Music"" makes a stirring opener for any compilation, perfectly melding McCabe's searing guitar lines with Ashcroft's spacey vocals. ""If love is a drug then I don't need it,"" Ashcroft declares. The second single from the second record, ""On Your Own,"" introduced audiences to the acoustic balladry-- with handclaps!-- that would reach full bloom on Urban Hymns. It also proved that Ashcroft suffers from the same lyrical banality that often marked Noel Gallagher's compositions. ""Gotta get rid of this hole inside,"" Ashcroft chants, and it sounds like a revelation rather than a tired cliche. Two tracks earlier, ""History"" is another A Northern Soul ballad, with strings from John Lennon's ""Mind Games"" and enough rarefied sadness for a Ford Madox Ford novel.
This Is Music boasts four songs from The Verve's masterpiece, Urban Hymns, and all are as revelatory now as they must have been when they capped off Ashcroft's Brit-rock bildungsroman. ""Sonnet"" verges on sappy, but some of Ashcroft's Bono-tastic bombast makes the song soar. ""Lucky Man"" applies the same formula to existential angst and what Whitney Houston called ""The Greatest Love of All."" Both ballads are good, but neither can compare to ""The Drugs Don't Work,"" a marvel of subtlety amid world-weary lyrics-- ""All this talk of getting old is bringing me down""-- and understated strings. This was a hit because it's fucking great. It's that simple.
""Bittersweet Symphony"" marches brazenly through a day in the life, staring head-on at the immutability of the human spirit and our paradoxically mercurial nature (""I'm a million different people""); both realities are true, the song suggests. In America, it's The Verve's only well-known song, but it's one hell of a legacy.
Of course, The Verve also are to blame for the uneven British wuss-rock of Travis (once likened to ""cheese on toast"" by Damon Albarn), Keane, and The Veils. They've even influenced American bathos-mongers like Howie Day, who's been known to cover ""The Drugs Don't Work"" in his tantrum-filled live shows. Alas, the two bonus tracks at the end of the compilations don't bolster The Verve's defense. Urban Hymns-era unreleased track ""This Could Be My Moment"" is elegant, uplifting, and as catchy as a TV jingle, but it lacks the world-conquering vision of the songs that actually made that album. ""Monte Carlo"" features a pleasant bass groove, but as soon as I finish this sentence I'll have forgotten how it goes.
In sum, This Is Music: The Singles 92-98 features 12 classics and two superfluous tunes from the vault. If you already own the albums, you won't have much use for this compilation. New fans ought to start with Urban Hymns and work their way back, and the arbitrary track order here serves no one. But the songs' quality remains undeniable, and a greatest-hits disc is better than no Verve at all-- at least until Ashcroft writes the final chapter with a ""Behind the Music""-inspired reunion tour.

Loaded: Re-Loaded 45th Anniversary Edition,The Velvet Underground,1970/2015,10.0,"Originally released in 1970, the Velvet Underground’s fourth album, Loaded, is a perfectly conceived rock'n'roll album. Like the previous box sets in the Velvets’ current reissue campaign, this expanded 6xCD Re-Loaded collection is less about unearthing rare tracks than getting the story straight.
","Loaded is a perfect rock'n'roll record: 40 minutes long, five songs to a side, and not a single wasted note. Originally released in 1970, the Velvet Underground’s fourth album marked the moment where Lou Reed’s early gig as a Pickwick Records song doctor ceased to be an amusing footnote to the band’s story and became their governing principle. Loaded is the sort of proper album that feels like a greatest hits collection, with each track thoroughly inhabiting and mastering a dominant rock archetype: the hippy-dippy, harmony-rich singalong; the sneering, street walkin’ prowler; the cheeky honky-tonk throwback; the wedding slow-dance standard; the dirty blues grind; the lighter-waving, anthemic grand finale. Loaded remains the one Velvets album you can put on at a house party among mixed company without killing the vibe or sending people running for the door, and it contains the only song in their repertoire—""Sweet Jane""—that you have any hope of hearing on an oldies station today.
But being a perfect rock'n'roll album is a very different thing than being a perfect Velvet Underground album. Part of what makes the Velvet Underground’s official discography so unique is that each of the four dramatically different albums they released between 1967 and 1970 could be considered their definitive statement, and yet each could also be considered the outlier. However, in the latter sense, that distance is amplified with Loaded, and not just because Moe Tucker—the pounding heartbeat of the band—sat out the sessions to tend to her pregnancy, necessitating a drumming-by-committee approach. When stacked against the dark, droning psychedelia of The Velvet Underground & Nico, the flesh-melting distortion of White Light/White Heat, and the disarming quietude of The Velvet Underground, there’s nothing overtly contrarian about Loaded. It’s the album that plays least into the myth of the Velvets as transgressive avant-rock outsiders and speaks most loudly to their reality, as a working band playing half-empty bars, desperate to deliver a hit to their antsy major label minders.
That pressure was baked into the very title of the record, a directive from their Atlantic Records bosses to produce a record ""loaded"" with potential hit singles—and the band delivered on every count, except, of course, the sales part. In that respect, Loaded stands as one of rock’s first truly meta artifacts, prefiguring such label-baiting in-jokes as Neil Young’s Everybody’s Rockin’ rebuke to Geffen Records and Nirvana’s ""Radio Friendly Unit Shifter"". This is, after all, a rock 'n'roll album that advertises its populist intent with a song about rock'n'roll called ""Rock & Roll"". Past provocations gave way to carefree kicks: ""Head Held High"" is ""I’m Waiting for the Man"" fresh out of rehab; ""Train Round the Bend"" is ""Sister Ray"" sent to the confession booth. But while Loaded may constitute a concerted effort to play by the rules, the Velvets come off like boarding school-bound delinquents who spend their class time stifling giggles and sneaking snarky notes. Whether answering the Beatles’ optimistic ""Here Comes the Sun"" with the withering ""Who Loves the Sun?"" or crashing the Byrds’ country-rock rodeo on ""Lonesome Cowboy Bill"", Loaded feels as much like a sardonic comment on pop’s ruling class as a bid to join its rarefied ranks. Atop the immortal riff of ""Sweet Jane"", Reed declares, ""me, I’m in a rock'n'roll band,"" before adding a ""huh""—and, after a million listens, it’s still hard to tell if it’s being delivered with a smirk or a shrug.
Alas, all that contradictory tension proved emblematic of deeper fissures running through the band. As this six-disc box set expansion of Loaded makes clear, the Velvets’ most airtight album ironically bears telling signs of their unravelling. Compiling remastered stereo and mono versions of the album, demos, alternate mixes, outtakes, a surround-sound DVD album mix, and two live sets, Loaded: Re-Loaded 45th Anniversary Edition highlights the painstaking tweaks and tinkering that went into making a seemingly effortless rock'n'roll album. Like the previous box sets in the Velvets’ current reissue campaign, Re-Loaded is less about unearthing rare tracks (much of the bonus material here first surfaced on 1997’s Fully Loaded) than getting the story straight, and properly contextualizing the output of a band whose official albums have been overwhelmed by a continuous stream of posthumous live albums, rarities compilations, and bootlegs. In the case of Loaded, the stereo and mono mixes don’t exist merely to satisfy differing listener preferences, but to present conflicting visions for the album. The former contains the extended versions of ""Sweet Jane"" and ""New Age"" that were eventually pared down for the official November 1970 release, much to Reed’s chagrin; he had left the band shortly after recording was completed, effectively sealing the album’s doomed fate before it even hit stores.
Tellingly, on Loaded, Reed already sounds like he’s handing the keys to the band over to bassist Doug Yule, who sings lead on four of the album’s 10 songs and plays much of the instrumentation. In contrast to John Cale, the band co-founder he replaced in 1968, Yule was never so much Reed’s foil as his eager understudy, with a more naturally melodic voice that buffed away Reed’s rough edges. But that’s no slight: Yule’s smooth-talker act yields the album’s most subversive moments, whether selling the bitter cynicism of ""Who Loves the Sun?"" as shiny, happy, ba-ba-da-ba pop, or playing the hotel bar-prowling hustler on ""New Age"" who sycophantically woos a faded movie star for a one-night stand only to cruelly discard her as ""over the hill."" And as the outtakes disc reveals, ""I Found a Reason"" could’ve easily wound up as a straight Dylan rip, before Yule’s angelic harmonies helped transform it into the most gorgeously celestial ballad in the Velvets’ canon. (Partially due to outstanding contractual commitments, Yule would soldier forth under the Velvet Underground name without any other original members for 1973’s largely forgotten Squeeze, an album unlikely to enjoy its own 45th-anniversary box set moment.)
More than just a collection of song scraps, Re-Loaded’s demo stash lets us imagine how Loaded might’ve turned out without the hitmaking ambitions, from the rough-hewn takes of future Reed solo standards like ""Satellite of Love"" to the organ-swirled fantasia of ""Ocean"" (the most prog the Velvets ever got) to a molasses-slow version of ""Sweet Jane"" that anticipates the Cowboy Junkies’ codeined cover. Meanwhile, the first live disc—a remaster of Live at Max’s Kansas City—offers a glimpse of the arena-ready powerhouse the Velvets had become just prior to Reed’s exit. (The two sets that make up the show—one devoted to rockers, the other to ballads—were recorded by Factory regular Brigid Polk on August 23 1970, reportedly Reed’s last night fronting the band; the version included here omits two tracks from the 2004 double-disc reissue of the complete concert, presumably to make it fit on a single disc.) If Loaded is the closest the Velvets ever got to becoming the Rolling Stones, on Max’s Kansas City they practically turn into the Who, as Doug’s brother Billy propels ""I’m Waiting for the Man"" and ""Beginning to See the Light"" with thundering Moon-shot drum rolls. But the recording is ultimately a faded snapshot of a live act in peak form at a career nadir: from the infamous intrusion of Jim Carroll trying to score some Tuinal to the idle audience chit-chat about the movie Patton that overwhelms ""Candy Says"", the Velvets are rendered as mere background noise even for the few devotees who bothered to come out to their shows.
The second concert included here—and of most interest to Velvets completists—predates the Max’s Kansas City show by a few months, but exudes an even greater degree of finality. Recorded by a fan on a reel-to-reel, the May 1970 set at Philadelphia’s Second Fret club sees Reed, Yule, and guitarist Sterling Morrison performing without a drummer (though Yule would hit the skins on a couple of songs). The stripped-down, slackened presentation greatly distinguishes it from other live Velvets documents of the era, while emphasizing certain subliminal textures, like the krautrock pulse running through ""Cool It Down"", or the tremolo wash on ""Train Round the Bend"" that essentially invents Spacemen 3 a good 12 years early. (There’s also a rare Reed-sung version of ""New Age"" with considerably different lyrics.) These curios aside, Live at Second Fret is the sort of moldy bootleg you probably only need to hear once, that is, if you can even make it all the way through—the recording has the fidelity of a pocket-dial. But the decaying, desolate presentation feels like an appropriate way to capture a band on the verge of disintegration. The set ends, as Loaded does, with ""Oh! Sweet Nuthin’"", and the two versions crystallize the album’s story in miniature: one is the grandiose statement of a band with chart-topping aspirations, the other is the lonesome sound of a band that ain’t got nothin’ at all.

"Bootleg Series, Vol. 1: The Quine Tapes",The Velvet Underground,2001,9.4,"In the more than three decades since Lou Reed left the band, the Velvet Underground's secured place in rock ...
","In the more than three decades since Lou Reed left the band, the Velvet Underground's secured place in rock's canon has become pretty much watertight. Their towering reputation as rock legends is now irrefutable. Not too shabby for a band who, in their day, only sold a handful of records, and whose live shows were meagerly attended. The Velvets' current status has stemmed primarily from their four studio albums and their wicked, junk-inspired depravity. But what tends to get lost in the praise is the band's reputed brilliance as a live act, a reputation that should only grow exponentially after people have a chance to hear Robert Quine's tapes.
Prior to this release, only a few ""official"" live Velvets releases existed: the incredible double-disc set 1969 and the tour documents from their mid-90s reunion being the most readily available. And then there's the dreadful Live at Max's Kansas City, which, while allegedly Reed's documented last stand with the group, is of interest only to those with dire historical interest or those with a need to hear table conversation revolving around drug scores. So now, with The Quine Tapes, the innocent public can finally find out what those confounded bootleggers have been shouting out for nearly thirty years: the Velvet Underground live on stage were a staggering dynamic presence, unpredictable and explosive.
While mentioning bootlegs, I guess I'd better say that what the title of this box set suggests is exactly what you get. Unlike Dylan's Live 1966 or the majority of officially released, artist-sanctioned ""bootlegs,"" this release is a murky, sometimes shitty-sounding audience recording by Robert Quine, a rabid VU fan who would later play guitar with both Richard Hell and Lou Reed. So, the caveat: if you're looking for a pristine audio document, this isn't it. But if you're keen on hearing a record that's crammed with beautiful group interchange and a series of magical moments, The Quine Tapes has it all in droves.
Capturing the band on a jaunt through the West Coast, Quine and VU archivist Bill Levinson have hand-selected a three-disc set of songs that finds the Velvets setting up camp in San Francisco amongst the hippies and peaceniks at two different venues: the Matrix and Family Dog. It shatters the illusion of the Velvets as decadent East Coast degenerates; on the contrary, Reed sounds surprisingly at ease, peppering the performances with friendly between-song banter and issuing often-revealing song introductions. The easiness spills over into the actual performances as well, which find the band stretching out into relaxed improvisations, often transforming arrangements and adlibbing lines. Of course, there are still the blistering sonic assaults that you'd expect from the Velvet Underground, but ultimately, Reed, Morrison, Tucker and John Cale replacement Doug Yule sound right at home.
What with Reed's seedy lyrics about blowjobs, sadomasochism and an NYC world of hookers and junkie cravings, a tranquil setting isn't exactly what you might expect from a Velvets concert. But the majority of tracks here move along at an easy, flowing pace-- rarely hurried and always allowing time for the band's meandering explorations. The two versions of ""I'm Waiting for the Man"" (both of which are universes apart from the anxious edginess evidenced on The Velvet Underground & Nico) are leisurely and laid-back, almost entirely abandoning the hard-edged grit of the original. In particular, the delightful version from the Matrix on the third disc is a gorgeous, loping stroll that finds Lou Reed in a remarkably jovial mood, whistling in between a set of improvised verses.
Elsewhere, the Velvets slam their feet on the gas pedal and push everything furiously into overdrive. With Cale's atonal viola scrapings and dissonant experiments gone from the fray, what we've got here is Reed and Sterling Morrison urging the others on with full-throttled, bursting-at-the-seams guitar fuzz. ""I Can't Stand It"" moves at a fever pitch for over six minutes with Tucker and Yule thumping away on percussive duties while Reed unleashes a frantic guitar solo. ""Foggy Notion"" is out of the gates in a heady blaze with Morrison and Reed swapping riffs in a Chuck Berry-esque rock and roll boogie.
The dim points on The Quine Tapes are few and far-flung. With the band stretching out into extended jams with re-arranged tempos and rhythms, the misses occur much less often than you might imagine. One of these few instances-- ""Follow the Leader,"" which opens disc two-- unfortunately drags on ad infinitum, the band drudging along in a clamorous din as if they never quite achieved liftoff. Some might consider Cale's absence a drawback to these recordings, especially on the renditions of earlier songs like ""Black Angel's Death Song,"" ""Heroin"" and ""Venus in Furs""; however, with Yule thudding away at the bass and organ, the rest of the Velvets crank up the intensity (and volume), substituting massive distortion and fuzz for Cale's screeching viola.
The best tracks here are the ones in which the band allows space for everything to unfold in a lazy haze, playing with sheer exuberance and joy. On the third disc, they sound completely rapt with the still fresh ""New Age"" and drift in a hypnotic trance while Reed repeats the mantra: ""It's the beginning of the new age.""
Still, what's most likely to delight fans on this set is the track Quine and Levinson have reserved for the final spot on each of the three discs, ""Sister Ray,"" which clocks in respectively at 24, 38 and 28 minutes. ""Sister Ray"" is pure rock enchantment, the band casting a spell on their audience and then freeing the rein on a guitar roller-coaster joyride. Like the Matrix version of ""I'm Waiting for the Man,"" each take of ""Sister Ray"" focuses more heavily on slipshod, careless joy than on the brilliantly concentrated intensity of the studio version. On the third disc's version (taken from Quine's tape of Washington University at St. Louis in May '69), Reed starts it with the warning, ""This is going to go on for awhile."" And it does, eventually climaxing into a churning maelstrom of distorted fuzz.
""Sister Ray"" was seemingly used to end each show, a cathartic spree into the outer limits of the band's sonic imagination. Beginning as a slow-burner each time, Reed spits out the debauched lyrics while the band jumpstarts the locomotive engine and lets the train begin its steady roll. Serving as a showcase for Reed's hyper-electric guitar-fuzz rave-ups, the band chugs along behind him, Yule both bashing and tickling notes out of the organ while Moe Tucker beats her kit in time with the engine. On two of the song's three takes, ""Sister Ray"" erupts into the twisted elation of ""Foggy Notion."" It's all such a magnificent, zigzagging mess that there's no wonder the Velvets seemed in such high spirits.
By the time the locomotive draws to a stop over four hours after the box set's first track, you're left in a wake of blistering guitar solos and pure rock and roll energy. Robert Quine was one of the lucky few to have experienced the Velvets live and, from the evidence gathered here, it looks like he caught them at their musical zenith. If the name of this box is any hint at all (and let's hope that it is), what we have here is the first in a series of archival releases that will serve to finally shed light on the Velvet Underground's ludicrously mind-boggling live incarnation. With their legendary status already secured, The Quine Tapes serves to ensure that it's never questioned.

The Complete Matrix Tapes,The Velvet Underground,2015,8.5,"The conventional wisdom is that the Velvet Underground were at their best on stage, and the high points of The Complete Matrix Tapes bear that out. You can think of The Complete Matrix Tapes as a greatly expanded, better-mixed version of 1969 with less perfect sequencing and four songs missing.
","The Velvet Underground were pioneers with blazing heads, Jesus' sons and daughter, the progenitors of seemingly everything that came after them. Assessing the four studio albums they released between 1967 and 1970 on the Pitchfork scale is like measuring a yardstick. They were also a perpetually struggling touring rock group like any other, playing extended engagements at large and small clubs all over the East and West Coasts, often two shows a night, to an audience of people who mostly just wanted to dance. The Complete Matrix Tapes is a document of that side of the band: Supposedly, it's a collection of the 42 songs the band played in two nights at a 100-capacity San Francisco club, The Matrix, some of which formed the bulk of 1969: The Velvet Underground Live with Lou Reed 40 years ago.
The conventional wisdom is that the Velvet Underground were at their best on stage, and the high points of The Complete Matrix Tapes bear that out. The peculiarly thin sonics of Matrix owner Peter Abram's recordings don't do Maureen Tucker's caveman drumming any favors, but they make a serious case for Sterling Morrison as God-Emperor of Rhythm Guitarists. The first disc's magnificent ""What Goes On"", with Morrison and Lou Reed's guitars chattering together at breathless speed while Doug Yule hammers at an organ, is the wellspring for, among other things, the Wedding Present's entire catalogue; ""Ocean"" is the seed and the soil for both Low and Godspeed You! Black Emperor. The version of the throwaway two-line rocker ""We're Gonna Have a Real Good Time Together"" on disc two is utterly thrilling, and the hushed, droning ""Heroin"" later in that set is a solid 20 years ahead of its time. Both ""White Light/White Heat"" and ""I'm Set Free"" are much more dramatic and vivid here than in their studio incarnations.
That said, some of the Matrix box's extended vamps get draggy, and there's a lot of song duplication here: four versions apiece of ""Some Kinda Love"", ""Heroin"", and ""We're Gonna Have a Real Good Time Together"", three apiece of ""There She Goes Again"" and ""I'm Waiting for the Man"", two apiece of seven others. But The Complete Matrix Tapes is useful as a way to hear how the Velvets constantly reworked their repertoire. Yule later said of Reed that ""there were times when he would invent or put together songs on the fly in a performance, and he'd just turn around and say, 'Follow me'"". The bizarre take on ""I'm Waiting for the Man"" that opens the box is slowed down to a crawling blues, extended to 13 minutes with some seemingly extemporaneous new verses; ""Lisa Says"", which the group had recorded in a studio just a month earlier, has almost totally rewritten lyrics and an entirely new bridge. Their most protean song, ""Sister Ray"", turns up in a relatively relaxed, noodly 37-minute performance that's far from its face-melting White Light/White Heat incarnation.
This box isn't exactly a grand opening of the vaults: as nice as it is to have all this stuff in one place, less than a quarter of it hasn't been officially issued before, and it's not like there's a shortage of Velvet Underground live recordings that could stand to be released for real. On the other hand, you can think of The Complete Matrix Tapes as a greatly expanded, better-mixed version of 1969 with less perfect sequencing and four songs missing, and considered that way, it's a jewel with a chip knocked off its top. Elliott Murphy's liner notes for *1969—*written in 1972, when the Velvet Underground were still a commercial nonentity with an enthusiastic but tiny cult—imagined a kid a hundred years later, in a ""classical rock'n'roll class,"" listening to the Velvets and wondering what to make of them. We're close to halfway there now, and their place in the canon is secure, but we still haven't entirely figured them out.

Gold,The Velvet Underground,2005,9.3,"Bargain-priced 2xCD set fails to capture VU's complete range, but it nevertheless includes all of the influential band's best-known tracks and is its best career anthology to date.
","As VU quips go, ""They only sold a few thousand records, but everyone who bought one started a band,"" is my least favorite; the ""everyone who bought one became a record critic"" variant seems more apt. For my money, the best thing ever written about the Velvet Underground remains this bit from Rob Sheffield's entry in the SPIN Alternative Record Guide: ""We understand this music so well because every corner of it has been absorbed. VU studio goofs have become established sub-genres.""
It's true. From the time they disbanded, the Velvet Underground have been present in most skewed versions of rock, from glam to punk to new wave to noise. If you only considered that Kraftwerk, Can, and David Bowie idolized and borrowed from VU, and think about all the places their music has traveled, well, that covers an insane amount of geography right there. Indie rock, in particular, is unthinkable without them, so it feels a bit odd to be reviewing a double-disc set of their best work for Pitchfork: Chances are, you've already internalized the four albums proper and Live 1969, and could tell me quickly which 30 songs are your all-time favorites. Needless to say, this compilation wasn't designed with the average Pitchfork reader in mind.
What it was designed to do-- and what it does rather well-- is replace 1989's The Best of the Velvet Underground: Words and Music of Lou Reed, an awkwardly titled, coldly assembled sampler that was in print far too long. Gold is two discs selling for a single disc price, and it includes almost all of the best-known and most often covered songs in their catalog: nine of 11 songs from The Velvet Underground & Nico, three of six from White Light/White Heat, five of 10 from Velvet Underground, and three live versions of the 10 songs from Loaded. The two unreleased collections VU and Another View are also well represented, and two songs from Nico's Chelsea Girl are included, as well.
Someone with $14 to spend who hasn't heard a note of this is in for a ride. Personally, I've had a hard time getting past ""Sister Ray"", which has the most gloriously filthy combination of guitar, organ, and amps ever assembled in one room. I just want to keep hitting the ""back"" button. But it's also been nice to revisit the shrieking viola of ""Venus in Furs"", which alarmed me when I first heard it so many years ago but now just sounds darkly sensual and almost playful. Hearing the heavy stuff next to twee bits like ""Sunday Morning"" and ""I'll Be Your Mirror"", which stand up beautifully, only affirms the staggering range of this band, as exemplified in the Sheffield quote above.
The more I think about their range, the clearer it becomes why the Velvet Underground are so difficult to anthologize for listeners who want to understand the full scope of what made them important. Their albums really are albums, and you need to hear the great songs next to the less accessible ones to get a full picture of the band. You gotta sit through ""European Son"" to hear how crazily noisy they could get and plod through ""The Gift"" to understand how badly they wanted their music to be taken as seriously as literature. And hey, how can a 30-song collection of Velvet Underground songs not include any Moe Tucker leads? Reed and John Cale provided the cool and Nico was around a while for the beauty, but the Velvet Underground picture is so must more interesting when you consider that this sweet-voiced woman occasionally took the mic to sing a simple ditty. Still, where summarizations of their catalog are concerned, Gold is easily the best yet, and while aspiring music fanatics will want and need all of the band's individual full-lengths, this should suit the rest of the world just fine.

White Light/White Heat,The Velvet Underground,1968/2013,10.0,"When the Velvet Underground's second album descended on the world in January, 1968, nobody was ready for it. As the story goes, it was a relentless, screeching, thudding, scoffing assault on the pop sensibilities of its time. For its 45th anniversary it's been reissued in expanded, remastered form, and listening to White Light/White Heat now, it doesn't quite fit the template of its legend.
","When the Velvet Underground's second album descended on the world in January, 1968, nobody was ready for it. The Velvet Underground and Nico, the year before, had had Andy Warhol's imprimatur to promise that its passages of bleeding-raw chaos were art; it had also had the complicated but unmistakable beauty of the songs Nico sang as a lifeline for the tiny mainstream audience that caught on to it at the time. White Light/White Heat didn't have either.
By the time they released it, the Velvets were downplaying the art-world connection (despite the very arty slash in the album's title, and the fact that its black-on-black sleeve was designed by the Factory's Billy Name). Nico was out of the band, although bassist John Cale would continue to work with her for years. And the album was a relentless, screeching, thudding, scoffing assault on the pop sensibilities of its time: six songs with lyrics designed to horrify the bourgeoisie (not that they'd have listened to the Velvet Underground in the first place), ending with a one-take, two-chord, 17-minute speedfreakout. It clung to the bottom of the album chart for two weeks, disappeared, and went on to become the glorious, tainted fountain from which all scuzz flows.
That's the White Light/White Heat of legend, anyway. For its 45th anniversary—closer to its 46th, but keeping time was never their strong point—it's been reissued in expanded, remastered form, as if what this pinnacle of sloppy noise needed was remastering. As always, the title track, which seems like it should start cold with Cale and Sterling Morrison's backing vocals, sounds like it's had a little trimmed off the top to remove an extraneous sound—although, of course, extraneous sounds are kind of the whole point of this album.
Listening to White Light/White Heat now, it doesn't quite fit the template of its legend. For one thing, Lou Reed's songwriting is often a lot more conventional than it's reputed to be. Strip away the noise and flash and references to illicit drugs and sex, and ""White Light/White Heat"", ""Here She Comes Now"", and ""I Heard Her Call My Name"" are all the sort of simple rock'n'roll readymades that Reed had been cranking out at Pickwick Records a couple of years earlier. (So is ""Guess I'm Falling In Love"", recorded in scorching instrumental form at the White Light sessions, which is practically the same song as the Rutles' ""I Must Be In Love"".)
For another, the live disc appended to this edition is a reminder that the Velvet Underground were radical in a totally acceptable way for their time—that, professionally speaking, they were a party band with an audience of hippies, who appeared on bills with the likes of Sly & the Family Stone, Canned Heat, Iron Butterfly, Quicksilver Messenger Service, and Chicago Transit Authority the year White Light/White Heat came out. The performance, apparently from John Cale's collection, was recorded at the Gymnasium in New York in April, 1967 (two of its songs previously appeared on the 1995 Peel Slowly and See box set). It presents the Velvets as a full-on boogie band, whose set is bookended by the instrumental grooves ""Booker T."" and ""The Gift""—turns out they're slightly different songs, contrary to what VU fans have assumed for the past few decades. The rest of the gig includes what might or might not have been the first public performance of ""Sister Ray"" (it was still a very new song, at any rate), and one legit addition to the canon: ""I'm Not a Young Man Anymore"", a chugging electric blues that wouldn't have been out of place in Creedence Clearwater Revival's early repertoire.
So once this mysterious black-on-black artifact is demystified, what's left of it? More mystery, it turns out. What possessed Cale to start playing an out-of-time, two-note bass part louder than anything else at the end of ""White Light/White Heat"", and how could he have guessed that that was a great idea? Was the famous split-second pause before Reed's splatterbomb solo on ""I Heard Her Call My Name"" intentional? What the fuck was up with Reed filling in words—""SWEETLY!""—in the middle of Cale's vocal on ""Lady Godiva's Operation"", and why is it still hilarious? Speaking of that song, might lyrics about a delicate hypersexual creature interacting with ""another curly-headed boy,"" directly followed by a medical horror-show, have anything to do with a curly-headed songwriter who was given electroconvulsive therapy to ""cure"" his bisexuality as a teenager? Why is ""Sister Ray"" way, way more potent than any other extended jam on a simple riff by an American band of the 60s?
It's surprising to hear anything besides the universe catching its breath after ""Sister Ray"" ends, but the first disc of this reissue is filled out with other previously released evidence of John Cale's final months in the Velvet Underground: the instrumental ""Guess I'm Falling In Love"", both versions of the electric-viola showcase ""Hey Mr. Rain"", and the band's thoroughly charming stab at making a commercially viable single, ""Temptation Inside Your Heart""/""Stephanie Says"". There's also a previously unheard alternate take of ""I Heard Her Call My Name"" (not quite as good as the official one, and mostly interesting to hear which of Reed's apparent ad-libs weren't), and one fascinating curio: an early version of ""Beginning to See the Light"", recorded at the ""Temptation Inside Your Heart"" session. By the time the song appeared on The Velvet Underground in 1969, it had become lither and wittier, and Reed had sharpened a few of its lyrics; this broad-shouldered, clomping version is distinctly not there yet, but everything the Velvets released on their official albums is so canonical that it's strange and heartening to realize that their songs didn't just spring into existence already perfect.

The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico,The Velvet Underground,2012,9.0,"This limited six-disc set of the 1967 classic includes remasters, alternate versions and mixes, practice sessions recorded at Andy Warhol's Factory, a live recording, and a remaster of Nico's Chelsea Girl, on which the Velvets performed.
","Forty-five years after its release, everything that was supposed to have made The Velvet Underground & Nico special has been nearly eradicated by its own legend. The most dangerous record of 1967 has been absorbed into the establishment rock canon; the paradoxical fame it earned from its hilariously terrible sales figures in its early years has been negated by reissue after deluxe-edition reissue; and its transgressive kinky-druggy menace has been smothered by the embrace of millions of overly precious Wes Anderson acolytes. Is a limited-edition ""super deluxe"" six-disc box set really going to help restore any of the ineffable outsider cool that it's lost over the years? Actually, yeah, it is.
The new super deluxe edition of TVU&N consists of a new stereo remaster of the album, a new mono remaster (both taken from the original tapes), a disc of alternate versions and mixes of the songs, a disc of practice sessions recorded at Andy Warhol's Factory, a live recording from around the time the album was recorded (spread across two discs), and a remaster of Nico's solo debut, Chelsea Girl, which the Velvets performed on. So aside from the 45 minutes of Chelsea Girl, you've got five hours of essentially the same 11 songs presented over and over in various levels of audio fidelity. On paper it may seem indulgent, but listening through the entire massive collection of material results in a sharper-edged portrait of the group than there's ever been, with all of the danger filled back in.
First there's the album proper. The remastering process was handled by Bill Levenson, who's been working on Velvets material since the mid-80s rarities collections VU and Another VU, and who oversaw the 1995 Peel Slowly and See box set that collected all of the group's studio recordings. Levenson knows the material well enough to keep from making it sound too clean. The amp hiss, tape saturation, and overall grit that made TVU&N leap out from the scores of mannered psychedelic rock albums released around the same time is still firmly in place; it's just that the grit sounds better.
The stereo mix breathes in a way that the album never has before. As incredible as it sounds, though, the mono version on the second disc provides the set's first moment of serious revelation: It doesn't breathe at all. In fact, with every throbbing bassline and squalling viola set dead center, the mix is suffocating. The transformative effect it has on the songs is unreal. Lou-fronted rockers like ""I'm Waiting for the Man"" and ""Run, Run, Run"" leap out from the speakers with an aggression that other versions lack. ""All Tomorrow's Parties"", ""Venus in Furs"", and ""The Black Angel's Death Song"" are oppressively noisy, but pleasurably so. It's a sensual sensory overload that underlines just how successful the group was at the music-as-S&M game it was playing with listeners.
Disc four is even rawer, and removes the last bit of remaining studio refinement to expose the Velvets' primal proto-punk heart. The first half is a reproduction of the one-of-a-kind acetate discovered by a record collector in a New York City street sale in 2002-- and sold on eBay a few years later for over $25,000-- that contained the first version of the album that the band delivered to Columbia Records (and which the label rejected). Some of the tracks would end up on the version of album that Verve issued after taming them down during another round of mixing; others were re-recorded entirely. Compared to the familiar finished version the material sounds unhinged. Moe Tucker's rudimentary drumming on an alternate version of ""Heroin"" is primitive to the extreme, while the original mix of ""Femme Fatale"" place a bizarre falsetto backing vocal from one of the male members high enough in the mix to put a listener on edge. And since the audio's taken straight from a beat-up acetate the whole fantastic mess is covered in crackles and hiss.
The rest of disc four is pulled from a taped rehearsal at the Factory a few months before the Scepter sessions, previously available in bootleg form. Parts of it are more interesting than listenable, like the band dicking around while Lou Reed patiently attempts to explain the lyrics to ""Venus in Furs"" to Nico. Other parts are jaw-dropping, like a version of ""Run, Run, Run"" that quickly turns itself inside out and transforms into a frenetic, semi-improvised Bo Diddley impression that's denser and heavier than almost anything else in the Velvets' catalog and can demand repeat plays back to back.
What makes moments like this, and the set in general, so compelling is that you get a picture of the group as a living, breathing band, separate from the performances that would be frozen in time and started on a long march to iconhood a little over a year later. For a minute-- or sometimes for 12-- you get a sense of what they really were, which is just another garage outfit hopped up on pills and playing rock'n'roll music so hard that it starts flinging off parts. The difference is that their garage was the Factory, and that they were willing to ride it far closer to fully falling apart than anyone else.
That's the image that sustains the final two discs, which together comprise a bootlegged live set from Columbus, Ohio's Valleydale Ballroom in November, 1966, four months or so before TVU&N was released. While someone-- maybe a devoted fan of the Factory scene-- yells out Nico's name when she introduces ""All Tomorrow's Parties"", you get the very clear idea that very few people in the crowd know who the Velvet Underground are, or like what they're playing. You can hear maybe two or three members of the audience clap after the opener ""Melody Laughter"", a 28-minute jam that's mostly noisy drone with a brief pop coda at the end. After a feedback-filled scorched-earth rendition of ""Black Angel's Death Song"", Lou Reed snarls at the audience, ""If it's too loud for you, you move back.""
A few months later, right after the release of The Velvet Underground & Nico, the group would convene to record parts of Nico's Chelsea Girl, which is a fine baroque folk-pop album, but nothing approaching that first record. The three other LPs the group recorded before Reed left the band almost four years after that show were great in their own rights, but paled in comparison to TVU&N. Listening to the live recording and hearing the silences between the songs, though, it's easy to imagine a roomful of people being pummeled by this strange, intimidating noise, and seeking safety in the back of the room, completely unaware that the band they're being assaulted by was at that moment (and for not much longer), the best in the world.

The Sleeping Beauties: A Collection of Early and Unreleased Works,Vangelis Katsoulis,2014,7.3,"Not to be conflated with fellow Greek countryman and the Chariots of Fire theme composer, this particular Vangelis is also a composer of dulcet tones, yet one whose body of work has hovered just under the radar outside of his native country since the 1980s. This handy introduction to his work shows this composer’s wide range.
","Not to be conflated with fellow Greek countryman Evangelos Odysseas Papathanassiou, whose “Chariots of Fire” theme has become ubiquitous Muzak the world over, this particular Vangelis is also a composer of dulcet tones, yet one whose body of work has hovered just under the radar outside of his native country since the 1980s. Discogs lists nine studio albums credited to Katsoulis, which span from 1986’s Minimal Suite to his most recent, 2011’s Pictures from Inside.
But the first time most 21st century listeners might have heard Katsoulis was on the fascinating compilation Into The Light: A Journey Into Greek Electronic Music, Classics & Rarities, which was released less than two years ago and now fetches ludicrous sums online. That comp introduced Greece’s fertile, if unheralded music, scene and heretofore-unknown artists like George Theodorakis and Costas Charitodiplomenos, all of whom blur the lines between ambient, avant garde electronic composition, and New Age drifts in a heady manner. While Vangelis’ contribution didn’t quite break the two-minute mark, it showed an intriguing voice at work.
All three aforementioned genres appear in Katsoulis' oeuvre, and this handy introduction to his work shows this composer’s wide range. The track included on that comp, ""Improvisation"" opens side two of this album; it's a dizzying mix of crisp percussion, pillowy synth chords, and finely minced “choir” presets that could easily be mistaken for something off of R Plus Seven. The track suggests that what might have scanned as New Age softness back in the '80s now offers up a glimpse into the 21st-century avant-garde.
The eleven tracks compiled here are ephemeral and lovely, if not always memorable. Four of them first appeared on his 1987 album The Slipping Beauty (the title a play on Tchaikovsky’s “The Sleeping Beauty”) and the title track reveals the kind of shimmering poly-rhythmic tones that bring to mind the likes of Philip Glass. Yet, on “Earth Beat”, heavy drums mix with featherweight keys and a foreboding synth note that sounds like the ominous opening bit of Michael Jackson’s “Beat It.” There’s flute trills on “The Eternal Return”, mixed into a bass glissade, screwed-down vocal growls and hand drums that give the track a strange feel of being both airy and dark. The electric bass on “Longing” sounds like Katsoulis is doing his best overly-busy-solo-Sting impression, but the violin melody remains evocative.
In the composer’s notes, Katsoulis writes that his work is closely related to the processes of time, and one particular aspect fascinates him most of all: “Beauty, which being subject to decay, has such a fleeting nature.” The most intriguing moments on The Sleeping Beauties are those that both comment on time and also take their time revealing their quirks and charms. The nearly ten-minute “Enigma” is an odd mix of what might otherwise scan as interstitial music on an afternoon talk show, now dilated into long form modern composition.
The two pieces that close the set also hover in that expanded space. The previously unreleased “Imago”, from 2012, builds from a rippling keyboard line that is a sonic speedball, at once mimicking the brightness of steel drums and the pensive moments of an '80s cop show. Soprano saxophone, violin, guitars, keyboard and percussion comprise “Epilogue”, each element cycling as new timbres are introduced. It’s an evocative piece, one that showcases the type of minimalism that informs not just Steve Reich pieces but also waiting room music, each in its own manner soundtracking the passage of time.

Teatime Dub Encounters EP,Underworld,2018,4.7,"On their collaborative EP, the UK electronic duo provides a lush and polished bed of sound for Iggy Pop to grouse about the state of the world.
","Iggy’s got a few complaints: The world’s changing, nothing’s fun anymore, he hardly has any friends and the ones he does have are a pain, the music industry is a drag, his reputation isn’t what it used to be. Oh, and you can’t smoke on flights. On an EP filled with these kinds of lamentations, one couplet neatly epitomizes his gripe: “It’s getting harder to be free/It’s getting so much harder to be me.” The first line might be on the money, but the second reduces his message to one of solipsistic whining.
Pop belongs to a tiny club—alongside Keith Richards, George Clinton, and perhaps no one else—of the hard-living, perma-cool rock-icon survivor whose lives are marked by a steel imperviousness to consequences. Pop’s work writhed and spasmed to historic effect while he remained, apparently, unbreakable. As the frontman of the Stooges, he set the high-water mark for punk intensity. As a solo artist, he narrated the tumultuous dreamlife of a junkie street urchin who was also a star. Now, teamed up with UK electronic duo Underworld on Teatime Dub Encounters, he sounds like something else entirely: a resentful baby boomer grumbling about the state of the world.
The collaboration came about via a bit of sabotage in 2017: With the release of Danny Boyle’s T2 Trainspotting looming, Underworld began to envision their own sequel. After all, their anthem “Born Slippy (Nuxx)” highlighted the iconic soundtrack to the original film (the start of the disc was Iggy’s 1977 groover “Lust for Life”). A plan was hatched to get Pop to a meeting at a hotel and surprise him, upon arrival, with a fully functioning studio and a batch of tracks ready for vocal overdubs. The fruits of this impromptu session sound exactly as you might expect. Underworld’s compositions are lush and polished, while Iggy’s ad-libs tend to spin their wheels, at times pausing and sputtering while he searches for the next word or phrase.
The pairing itself is a canny one. Iggy’s always had a pop edge that balanced out his feral persona, and Underworld frequently added doses of weirdness to their crossover electronica. In the Venn diagram of the two groups, there’s an overlap that’s worth exploring and might even bear fruit. So it’s unfortunate that Iggy, now 71, is in such a half-baked and aggravating form. His voice has the leathery gravitas to pull off more reflective moods while still being elastic enough to go for a full frontal attack.
But he needs better lyrics than these. On “Bells & Circles,” he bemoans an uptightness encroaching on his daily life.

If I had wings I wouldn’t do anything beautiful or transcendent
No! I’d get my finger into everything I wanted
I’d do all the beautiful things
Those things you can’t do
Because nobody wants you to be able to do the things that make you feel good

The man dated Nico, made it out the other side of a heroin addiction, collaborated with Bowie, helped to invent modern rock, and hasn’t worked a day job since the ’60s—who exactly is victimizing him? The revealing double use of “beautiful” suggests a worldview hopelessly skewed by entitlement. Later he bemoans a character named Johnny for getting a mortgage, thereby killing his inner child. At a time when the middle class is reaching its nadir and basic services like health care and education are cripplingly unaffordable for many Americans, stale critiques of a dated bourgeoisie are callously out of touch.
Die-hard followers of both artists may find something to love here, in the same way Star Wars fans devour hastily written, officially branded novels set in the same universe. Aging rockers might get a jolt of smug satisfaction from Iggy’s rants, but few will be genuinely thrilled. If Iggy were to dissect his pride more surgically, he could harness some genuinely moving work. But on Teatime, his reflections lack rigor and drift quickly into petty grievances.
Closer “Get Your Shirt” poses as advice to a younger generation of musicians on the perils of the music business. But it’s just a matter of time before the real thesis comes: “Wait for the music of the spheres/To move the stars/Into the right position/To reclaim my fortune/I want my shirt back!” Artists as varied as LCD Soundsystem and Drake have made riveting art exploring vanity and its pitfalls, and in the process gotten more than a few shirts. Will Iggy take us into his dark heart of vulnerability with the next line, reminding us why we should care about his fate? “Not a hair shirt!” he whines. “A fun fair shirt!” This type of flourish used to represent Pop ’s primal id, the one he spent his career turning into blistering art. But, as Freud said, “Where id is, there shall ego be,” and it takes a lot of ego to make a record as dull and demanding as Teatime.

Beaucoup Fish,Underworld,1999,7.4,"Originally released in 1999, Underworld's newly reissued rave-inspired fifth LP is often thrilling, but is mainly a fascinating snapshot of the UK group at a moment of ambivalence.
","It was 1999, and Underworld were in a dangerous place. After two decades of ups and downs—they’d been dropped by labels and management, gone deeply into debt, and cycled through four different band names—Underworld had become what they’d decided they never wanted to be again: a real band.
This was a significant change of fortunes from just six years prior. When Rick Smith and Karl Hyde, bandmates since 1979, and a DJ named Darren Emerson, a little more than 10 years their junior, released the trio’s landmark 1993 album Dubnobasswithmyheadman, they were starting from scratch. After getting turned on to the UK’s acid-house scene and abandoning the unfashionable, high-gloss pop-rock of Underworld’s previous iteration, they’d spent the previous couple of years recording a series of dance singles that they sold out of the back of their car.
Underworld weren’t a natural fit for the rave scene—there was Smith and Hyde’s age, for one thing, along with Hyde’s rambling, stream-of-consciousness vocals—but somehow, they struck a chord. Dubnobasswithmyheadman anticipated a growing desire for what’s sometimes been called “progressive house,” but in their case just meant a sound that was psychedelic and enveloping, with a little bit more personality than much of the era’s dance music. (Melody Maker called it a “breathtaking hybrid [that] marks the moment that club culture finally comes of age and beckons to everyone.”) Second Toughest in the Infants, the second album from their new incarnation, burrowed deeper into their moody psychogeography and fueled their continued upward trajectory with critics and fans. Then came Trainspotting. Getting “Born Slippy .NUXX”—until then, a B-side that had attracted little attention—onto the film’s soundtrack earned the band a whole new set of fans, particularly in America, where their vestigial rock trappings poured a spoonful of sugar over the bitter pill of unfamiliar rave beats.
Inspired by rave’s parallel economy—a world apart, massive but underground, with few ties to the old-guard music industry—Underworld had set out to remain independent. But their success, ironically, found them absorbed back into the pop music machine. Beaucoup Fish, the best-selling Underworld album, is fascinating precisely for the ways in which it captures them at a moment of ambivalence.
In many ways, the ’99 record represents a logical extension of their previous two albums. Track lengths have shrunk a bit—there’s certainly nothing like the pair of 15- and 16-minute colossi that kicked off Second Toughest—but they feel long, with tumbling synth arpeggios pushing forward like great big sawtoothed corkscrews. Even at just four and a half minutes long, the barreling piano house of “Push Upstairs” seems epic. And the way the 12-minute opener “Cups” cycles through its different phases even feels like a DJ set in miniature.
On balance, it’s the heaviest of the trio lineup’s three albums. One of the principal takeaways from this remastered reissue is how thrillingly fast techno used to be: Most of the proper club cuts here hover around a blistering 140 beats per minute, and their drum work pulls no punches. Underworld had always taken pride in their idiosyncratic approach: “The purists all hated us, because we were so eclectic,” Hyde told SPIN. But the only thing standing between “Moaner” and techno’s textbook definition is Hyde ranting, “Get the sound in your head/Black metal walls are crawling/I am the hunger above your town,” like a sidewalk preacher beneath his end-of-days sandwich board. (Another revelation here is how much, in retrospect, Sleaford Mods owe to Hyde’s imagistic armchair-sociologist shtick.) “Kittens,” ironic title aside, is an even more straight-down-the-middle take on boomy, big-room techno, albeit fleshed out with pastel-colored shoegaze guitars—part rave, part rocket launch. Blame it on the crash cymbals, maybe, but the track’s atmospherics have aged far better than the beats. The best of the bangers is undoubtedly “Shudder / King of Snake,” which riffs on the bassline of “I Feel Love” and adds bare-knuckled chord stabs and so much percussion that it sounds like a street fight between rival samba schools. There’s not a tougher piano-house track in the annals of Ibiza.
Despite the trio’s significantly raised profile, Beaucoup Fish makes surprisingly few overtures to pop. The only thing that comes close is “Bruce Lee,” a 100-BPM breakbeat tune that takes after big-beat contemporaries like the Chemical Brothers and Fatboy Slim. Still, there’s no melody to speak of, just an atonal clank buttressed by turntablist scratching. Hyde’s lyrics, which resemble scrambled advertising copy (“Life kid suck/Drink from the box/The juice kicks up/Live give suck the box drink/Yeeaaaah”) are “pop” only in the way Warhol’s soup cans were pop. More intriguing might be two nearly ambient sketches, “Winjer” and “Skym,” that set Hyde against a backdrop of synths and little else. Both songs suggest the lengths the group was willing to go to test listeners’ expectations; that they sequenced the two songs side by side on the album only reinforces what a curiously atmospheric vision they were pursuing.
The album’s most exciting and enduring moments are the ones that pair this suggestive ambient energy with their rhythmic instincts. “Cups” teases a hint of that: Hyde’s bluesy, vocodered melody swirls like colored smoke over one of the album’s most hypnotic grooves, and incidental keys sparkle like the light from a disco ball. “Something Like a Mama” smoothes over its tumbling breakbeats with soft sunrise pads, and the unresolved qualities of its bass-and-synthesizer counterpoints give the track an unmistakably searching feel. And then there’s “Jumbo,” one of the two or three most affecting tracks in their entire catalog. It’s as fast as anything on the album, fueled by crisp, snapping drums and a spring-loaded bassline, yet it feels like falling upward through clouds, like a midsummer snowstorm. It’s here that they truly made good on the immersive, otherworldly potential that always inhabited their music; it’s here that they outdid themselves as makers of extroverted music for introverts, of rave anthems for people happiest alone in their heads.
The extras on the 4x-CD expanded edition comprise mainly alternate takes and DJ remixes. The latter are mainly of interest to collectors. Unless you’re a working drum ‘n’ bass DJ, chances are you don’t need both a vocal mix and an instrumental of DJ Hype & DJ Zinc’s jump-up reworking of “Bruce Lee.” (That said, the techno titan Dave Clarke’s “King of Snake” remix, which folds “It Takes Two”-style hiccups and a bizarrely backmasked cymbal into the original’s rushing chord stabs, is truly a thing to behold.)
The alternate takes are not much more essential, but they offer an intriguing glimpse of any number of possible albums that Beaucoup Fish might have turned out to be. “Skym - A A1317 Nov 97” plays out like an unplugged rehearsal for keys, brushed drums, and Hyde’s unadorned voice. “Bruce Lee - Ricks 1st Dobro Mix” pitches the tune up by a half-step or so and adds silvery steel guitar to the mix. And “Jumbo - Diff Bass 2 A1317 Nov 97” sounds virtually identical to the album version, but without the bright synths and cutting bassline of the latter, it feels like a dimmer switch has been turned down; it’s good, but it doesn’t come anywhere close to the glories of the canonical version.
Hyde has complained that by Beaucoup Fish, some of the “rough edges” had come off their work. “We’re getting a bit professional,” he said of that period. “And by that I mean less intuitive, and more streamlined.” Yet what the outtakes show is how easily it all could have gone wrong. The album’s best tracks, like “Jumbo,” are the most streamlined ones; the album is most successful when it strikes a balance between their habitual grit and a newfound polish. Perhaps they never meant to come back as a real band, but the best of Beaucoup Fish finds them at the height of their powers.

Underworlds,Mammoth Grinder,2013,7.3,"On their third album, Mammoth Grinder, who share members with Hatred Surge and the now defunct Iron Age, offer a manic blend of death metal, crust, and punk. It's a savage collection that finds the Austin quartet coming into their own as genre-bashing geniuses.
","Reading metal reviews would be a lot more entertaining if we'd occasionally pause and allow our imaginations to run wild through some of the album titles and band names. Monikers like Palace of Worms and Lake of Blood capture the mind’s eye, while Ride for Revenge, Pig Destroyer, and diSEMBOWLMENT send chills down the spine. While a Skeletal Spectre haunts your dreams and a Front Beast with One Tail, One Head lurks in the shadows behind your bedroom door, a Mammoth Grinder sounds like a fearsome contraption in a scene from some wintry Neolithic Fargo, a sputtering metallic beast cranking out ropes of dark, bloody flesh and orchestrating a chorus of deafening clangs, frenzied roars, and whirring blades as the show turns crimson beneath it.
You could describe the Austin band Mammoth Grinder's latest album in much the same way. It's been four years since the release of Extinction of Humanity, but Mammoth Grinder’s third full-length Underworlds maintains that forward momentum-- it's a savage collection that sees the four-piece (who were a trio the last time we heard from them) heading straight for the jugular from the first note and tearing through the title track in under two minutes. It’s the kind of entrance that catches you off guard, and the intensity doesn’t let up. When they go slow, it’s all sludgy, bludgeoning breakdowns and Stockholm grooves; when they speed up, it’s a torrential storm of gutter thrash and hardcore punk that aims to fuck things up faster than a Sharknado. The band have long incorporated death metal elements into their songwriting, and the 2011 split with a grind-heavy Hatred Surge (with whom they share key members) may have dropped some major hints, but on Underworlds, Mammoth Grinder have fully come into their own as genre-bashing geniuses.
“Wraparound Eyes” stomps in with a big fat groove and dips in and out of the same, padding out the rest with Disfear-driven d-beats and Entombed riffs, while “Revenge” sounds like Bolt Thrower’s “... For Victory” sped up to 45 RPM with a few lines of yayo laid out on top. “Roperide” has the album’s best moshpit anthem-- you can almost see the bodies fly. Three-minute burner “Cog in the Machine” is an epic by Mammoth Grinder’s standards, and they use those extra thirty seconds to hammer their message home (hint: it’s not a very nice one). “Born in a Bag” is pure Swedish death down to the guitar tone and whiplash guitar solo, and album closer “Moral Crux” drags it all back down, a stoned stomp towards oblivion. (You can’t go wrong with a good “bleah!” grunt.) When not indulging his inner Matt Harvey, vocalist Chris Ulsh’s hoarse throat erupts again and again as a gravelly warning or enraged bellow; you can hear the spittle flying out and feel his white knuckle deathgrip on the mic.
The album is peppered with the kind of wild-eyed, squealing guitar licks that’d make Jeff Hanneman proud, and a big, hollow drum sound acts as a powerful backup generator for when the guitar and basslines need a bar or two to breathe. Brevity is the soul of wit, after all, and much like a particularly cutting Oscar Wilde diss, the short lengths of the songs come off as calculated and clever. Nothing feels hasty or rushed. Mammoth Grinder know exactly how to get in, cause a ruckus, and get out in three minutes or less, and aren’t interested in belaboring their point. They've earned the right to keep it tight.

Cosmic Crypt,Mammoth Grinder,2018,7.6,"Austin musician Chris Ulsh’s longest-running band returns with a revitalized lineup and a new commitment to death metal intensity.
","Best known as the drummer and sometime guitarist in Dallas thrash band Power Trip, Austin’s Chris Ulsh has spent the last decade or so exploring variations on a simple truth: metal and punk are forces that work best in league with each other. He is efficient, deadly, and never starving for riffs, whether working with pit-ready thrash, noisy punk, chugging powerviolence or good ol’ Venom-esque raunch. If it’s fast and loud, he’ll make gold. The longest-running of Ulsh’s many projects, Mammoth Grinder, hits the sweet spot between death metal and hardcore, particularly the tougher American varieties of both. The band was on ice for a while due to Power Trip’s intense touring commitments, but Ulsh has revived it for Cosmic Crypt, their fourth LP and first with two members of Iron Reagan, guitarist Mark Bronzino and drummer Ryan Parrish. Even with two-thirds of the band based in Richmond, the new album is an object lesson in exactly how Ulsh earned his reverence in Texas and beyond.
The biggest change to Mammoth Grinder’s approach this time is that Ulsh has switched to bass, leaving Bronzino to handle guitars. Perhaps as a result, Crypt doesn’t show much of the Swedish influence heard on 2009’s Extinction of Humanity or 2013’s Underworlds; they’ve exchanged buzzsaw guitar tones reminiscent of Entombed and Dismember for a more bass-heavy sound and deeper vocal delivery from Ulsh. That singing style, in turn, tips the LP further toward death metal, compared to past efforts where the group’s hardcore lineage was more noticeable. “Human Is Obsolete” and “Rotting Robes” are Mammoth Grinder at their most death metal yet, hitting with the force of an impenetrable phalanx. Elsewhere, “Molotov” opens with a floor-punching riff that would sound equally fitting coming from a bludgeoning death metal crew like Acephalix as it would a lean New York hardcore crew like Judge, ripping with a immediate cross-genre lizard-brain appeal.
The blown-out crust sound of Discharge’s foundational 1980s work remains another key spiritual influence on Mammoth Grinder. “Blazing Burst” feels as war-torn as that UK group’s nuclear-ravaged worlds; “Superior Firepower” combines crust’s noisier side with a feedback intro that immediately transitions into a relentless stomp. Ulsh’s spacey bass dive in “Blazing Burst” suggests another of his side projects, Impalers—it’s a lush flirtation in the middle of a minefield. Throughout the album, Bronzino prioritizes noise over technique in soloing, and his explosive entrances give Mammoth Grinder an unexpected dramatic flair.
One reason Crypt fits so effortlessly into the Mammoth Grinder canon is that the new lineup isn’t entirely new: Bronzino and Parrish were touring members in 2014, before Ulsh turned his focus to Power Trip. They’re ideal partners for Ulsh, as their background in Iron Reagan, a crossover thrash band, means they also value economy. Like the slew of new American death metal acts that came out starting at the beginning of this decade, this version of Mammoth Grinder takes from death metal’s faster and more brutish end, but it doesn’t fully fit into that or any stylistic niche. The simplicity heard here draws from Master; the ugliness brings to mind Autopsy; and none of the influences feel like they’re being hastily grafted together. Coincidentally, Crypt arrives not long after Slayer announced its “final” tour. Like those thrash greats’ classic Reign in Blood, this album presents a complete vision in a short running time, stirring metal and hardcore together into one giant, boiling cauldron.

Songs of Experience,U2,2017,5.3,"Years in the making, U2’s 14th studio album finds the band straining to reassert its relevance in a world where rock music has long since ceded its vanguard status.
","In the late 1980s, en route to Memphis on the mission that would be dubiously immortalized by the documentary U2: Rattle and Hum, Bono hitched a ride with a stranger whose car stereo dashed his spirits. The young driver had been listening to Def Leppard’s Mutt Lange-produced glam-metal opus Hysteria—and it sounded magnificent. Bono was awed. When at last it dawned on the driver who exactly he’d picked up, he switched out the Def Leppard tape for some vintage U2. By comparison, it couldn’t help but sound dull. “I think we were a little out of touch,” Bono reflected later, having heard what U2 lacked. “We weren’t as great as we figured we were.”
It is hard to believe that U2 were galvanized to write Achtung Baby! by a chance encounter with “Pour Some Sugar on Me” on cassette. But then that’s U2: Their art is fundamentally, inveterately emulous. The pursuit of relevance seems above all what motivates them to create. What are they doing, really, when time and again they endeavor to reinvent themselves, if not trying to remain fashionable—or, more precisely, to stave off obsolescence? In 1989, drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. told Bono he worried the band was “turning into the world’s most expensive jukebox.” The band could not abide it. “They became so bored playing U2’s greatest hits that one night they went out and played the whole set backward,” Bill Flanagan writes in his biography U2 at the End of the World. “It didn’t seem to make any difference.” It’s this inclination toward boredom and restlessness that has always secretly been U2’s animating force.
The fear of seeming “a little out of touch”: Nearly 30 years after Bono declared on stage that the band had to “go away and dream it all up again,” this is still the prime creative catalyst. And on Songs of Experience, U2’s 14th studio album, the anxiety is more apparent than ever. Bono, it seems, has been spending a lot of time around a lot of strangers’ car stereos, and what he’s concluded U2 lacks he’s undertaken resolutely to embrace. Behold the album’s many hallmarks of the modern: There are contributions by Kendrick Lamar (“American Soul”) and Haim (“Lights of Home”), and there are flourishes that conspicuously recall the xx (“Red Flag Day”) and Arcade Fire (“Get Out of Your Own Way”). Opening track “Love Is All We Have Left” invokes a distinctly Justin Vernon-ish vocoder, an homage we might dub “Bono Iver.” And “Summer of Love”—on which Bono croons “I been thinkin’ ‘bout the West Coast/Not the one that everyone knows”—suggests someone just discovered Born to Die.
Bono and the Edge have said that lately, innovation has been less evident in rock music than elsewhere—in “R&B, hip-hop, and pop,” according to a profile of the band in the New York Times. This academic interest in other genres is manifest across Songs of Experience. It’s clear in the subwoofer-trashing bass that undergirds “The Blackout,” the liveliest Adam Clayton has sounded in ages. It’s clear in the thick slabs of lurid distortion that course through “American Soul,” which last appeared, in much different form, as “XXX” on Kendrick’s DAMN. And it’s clear in the sumptuous, waterlogged beat that concludes the final track, “13 (There Is a Light),” reminiscent of Noah “40” Shebib and his legions of imitators. These are brazen attempts to capture the zeitgeist, even by U2’s standards. Their combined effect is dire: Songs of Experience is the shameless effort of four men in their late 50s to muster a contemporary, youthful sound.
Of course, the band’s aspirations toward relevance are tempered by a competing pursuit: Here they strive, as usual, to guarantee longevity. They want to seem in touch; they also want to canonize another classic. This, one presumes, accounts for the inclusion of more familiar-sounding U2 barn-burners such as “Love Is Bigger Than Anything in its Way,” which sounds almost exactly like one expects a U2 song with that title would, and lead single “You’re the Best Thing About Me,” which has already failed to take hold of the popular imagination.
“The problem with rock now is that it’s trying to be cool,” Bono said recently. “But clear thoughts and big melodies—if they come from a true place, they not only capture the instant, they become eternal in a way.” The Edge, meanwhile, said the band was concerned with whether these songs would “be played by people in a bar in 25 years.” Well, Songs of Experience does not much “capture the instant,” hunger to as it might, and it is safe to assume that while, say, “Pride (In the Name of Love)” or “New Year’s Day” have proven something like timeless, “Red Flag Day” and “The Showman (Little More Better)” will fall rather short of eternal. “How long must we sing this song?” Bono asked on “Sunday Bloody Sunday”—and they’ve been obliged to sing it nightly since 1983. With these songs, about a single tour should do.
Despite the blatant bid to sound modish and rejuvenated, U2 cannot help in certain respects but sound the same. Bono still writes Bono-brand howlers: He still lapses into prosaic platitudes (“Are you tough enough to be kind?/Do you know your heart has its own mind?”), moony cliche (“Free yourself to be yourself/If only you could see yourself”), and arena-rock patois (“You! Are! Rock’n’roll!”—the “you” there is America, naturally). Politics are addressed in earnest, to ludicrously ill-judged effect. Which is more vicariously embarrassing: the stretch of “Red Flag Day” that contrasts a tryst on the beaches of the Mediterranean with the deaths of Syrian refugees (“Baby let’s get in the water… so many lost in the sea last night”), or the portmanteau punchline that ends “American Soul,” which is simply: “refujesus”?
It is tempting to praise Songs of Experience on the basis of its mawkish wholeheartedness. It does indeed seem like the product of considerable toil: This thing has been in progress for something like three years now, and between its revisions, reconstructions, and post-election rewritings, it plainly benefits from more attention and effort than any U2 album since All That You Can’t Leave Behind. But it’s precisely this manifest ambition that makes Songs of Experience dispiriting. The music itself isn’t any better merely because this time around the band actually cares; all the industrious fervor amounts to meager flailing. It’s one thing to fail when you’re phoning it in: You leave hope that you could pull it off if only you tried. It’s quite another to fail when you’re giving it everything.

Achtung Baby [Super Deluxe Edition],U2,2011,9.5,"Achtung Baby is rightly known as one of rock's greatest reinventions because it was so complete. And just as the 1991 album both fulfilled and upended rock'n'roll myths, this coffee-table-book sized, 6xCD, 4xDVD set both props up Achtung and pokes a few holes in it.
","""If you give a pop star a shit pile of dough and he refuses to self-destruct, I think it is a bit wet,"" said a smoking, slicked-back, black-sunglasses-clad Bono in a 1993 interview on the UK music show ""Naked City"". ""I think it's part of the deal. If they don't die on a cross by 33, I'd ask for your money back."" Like many of the knowingly audacious quotes from the singer and his U2 mates during this period, it's a little tough to deduce the exact level of sincerity involved. And that was the whole idea. In the early 1990s, U2 were sending up the idea of a ""rock'n'roll star."" They were offering themselves as an ironic, postmodern band for similarly confused times. They were making fun of themselves and their own humorless, slate-faced 80s reputation. A year after Bono's casual quip about pop stars dying on a cross, Kurt Cobain killed himself. And in Nirvana's final video, for ""Heart-Shaped Box"", Cobain could be seen making wild eyes in front of one.
Achtung Baby and its accompanying Zoo TV tour lived within the slippage between perception and reality. ""Sometimes you can get far closer to the truth of what you're trying to say by highlighting what it isn't as if it were true,"" said the Edge on ""Naked City"". ""That's assuming we know the truth-- 'truth' is one of those words that's lost its meaning."" In the 80s, U2 seemed endlessly in search of a definite truth, whether in peace or god or love or some ambiguous combination of the three. Famously, they didn't find it.
But the quest was thrilling-- at least until 1988's album and film Rattle and Hum, which found the group looking and sounding spectacularly self-serious while gawkily paying tribute to some of their American heroes like Elvis Presley and B.B. King. The resulting critical backlash caused these open-hearted Irishmen to reflect, and they weren't crazy about what they saw in the mirror. ""We looked like a big, overblown rock band running amok,"" says Bono in an excellent new documentary called From the Sky Down that chronicles the band's pivotal turn-of-the-decade moment. And while that might seem like an aptly derisive opinion of today's incarnation of U2, it's important to remember that these guys originally came out of the cacophony of rule-breaking post-punk, a realm where bloated arena rock was the enemy. So they went away and tried to come up with a new way to seek some truth.
Achtung Baby is rightly known as one of rock's greatest reinventions because it was so complete. Sure, U2 changed their sound from chiming melodics to lurching, distorted rhythm. But they also changed their attitude, their demeanor, their look, their ideas on how to deal with celebrity. All of a sudden, they were funny, sexy, a bit dangerous-- three things few would've associated with U2 in the 80s. And yet, at their core, the band's values remained constant. They were still ethically minded and interested in the real-life connection between living beings. But the way they went about projecting those core tenets flipped. In TV-news parlance, their attitude switched from ""60 Minutes"" to ""The Colbert Report"".
This new era was conveniently spelled-out on Achtung's first single ""The Fly"" with the Edge's metallic skronk and Bono's conspiratorial, effected whisper of lines like, ""It's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest/ It's no secret that ambition bites the nails of success."" And just as the album goes lengths to both fulfill and upend rock'n'roll myths with thorny tales of deep betrayal, questioned fidelity, and ambiguous artifice, this coffee-table-book sized, 6xCD, 4xDVD set both props up Achtung and pokes a few holes in it, too.
Take the album's much-ballyhooed place of origin, Berlin's Hansa Studios. This was the location that played host to David Bowie and Iggy Pop's electronic-inspired masterworks Low and The Idiot. And Hansa is located near the Berlin Wall, which had only recently been breached when U2 set up there in the fall of 1990. Perched literally in the middle of historic liberation, U2 were meant to find inspiration in the world events around them and turn that spark into a new version of the band for a new decade. It's a great backdrop for a great story. But it didn't really go down that way. ""We're there, and greatness has left the building,"" Bono recalls in From the Sky Down, which features the band returning to Hansa earlier this year in preparation for their headlining set at Glastonbury.
While Berlin did inspire bits of the record-- ""Zoo Station"" was named after one of its prominent train terminals-- it hardly lived up to its lofty reputation. This serves as a lesson for U2, a band that shamelessly worships past rock heroes, to move past such naïve mythologizing. ""Berlin was a baptism of fire,"" says bassist Adam Clayton in the documentary. ""It was something we had to go through to realize what we were trying to get to was not something you could find physically, outside of ourselves, in some other city-- that there was not magic to it and that we actually had to put the work in and figure out the ideas and hone those ideas down."" This newfound pragmatism would help them to move past their fantasies about the sanctity of rock. So while Berlin played a part on Achtung Baby, it did so in surprising ways; though ""One"" was mostly written in a burst of inspiration in Hansa, most of the album truly came together once the group went back home to Dublin.
Most of the audio bonuses in this set are unfortunately superfluous, and don't offer much in terms of insight. There are two CDs filled with dance remixes, and while U2 were at the vanguard of big time rock bands embracing the notion of the remix, even the most devout rave nostalgist would have little use for six remakes of ""Mysterious Ways"". The disc of bonus material and B-sides is disappointingly slight, and another filled with early versions of every song on Achtung offers a few revelations-- an Irish jig-style version of ""Tryin' to Throw Your Arms Around the World"" has an easy charm, but generally, it's easy to see why these attempts were improved upon later. Achtung's even more electronic and weirder follow-up, 1993's Zooropa-- which was recorded in a creative frenzy during a break in the Zoo TV tour-- is also included, though it's generally (and somewhat unfairly) glossed over in all the accompanying materials.
The worthy additions in this ""super deluxe edition"" are nearly all visual. There's Anton Corbijn's gorgeous and colorful photography that covers its case, as well as a big, sturdy 84-page book. And then the four discs of video: It Might Get Loud director Davis Guggenheim's new 90-minute doc From the Sky Down, every video from the era, a full live gig taped in Australia in 1993, interview shows (like ""Naked City""), and, best of all, a playfully subversive TV special from 1992 that includes live footage from the Zoo TV tour as well as goofy interludes that play up the surrealism and insanity of the whole project. Moments like the ""Even Better Than the Real Thing"" video, with the band playing in a glass case while fans look on outside, successfully tie in all the pomo flourishes U2 were chasing. The group was at the forefront of bringing huge video screens into the live arena, and some of the tricks they pull off-- Bono ""dueting"" with a static-y Lou Reed or flipping channels to live local stations-- still look impressive. And for all the technical wizardry of the stage setup, the band still uses it to complement the music rather than overshadow it. Even 20 years on, the tour looks like something to behold, a singularly inventive experience that no band-- including U2 itself-- has been able to really expound upon in a meaningful way.
In the Zoo TV special, which originally aired during Thanksgiving weekend in 1992, a ""news commentator"" covering the show dubs it ""the most significant and exciting TV event since the Gulf War."" Some of the ideas behind Zoo TV and Achtung Baby were inspired by the television coverage of that initial Gulf War in 1991, and the bizarre reality of being able to switch channels from home shopping to MTV to the bombing of Baghdad. U2 recognized the dangers of this idea, when war turned into just more filler for the burgeoning 24-hour TV-news cycle. And instead of preaching against it in a high and mighty fashion, they embraced that chaos in an effort to expose it. Of course, our collective information overload has been upped exponentially since thanks to the internet, making the flashes of words and slogans that backed U2 during their live campaign seem eerily prophetic. Talking about the Zoo TV audience in the ""Naked City"" interview, drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. says, ""They're coming to a rock'n'roll show and watching television, what more can you ask for?"" He's joking, but as we go to arenas and see singers on big screens through our cellphone cameras, the question begins to answer itself.

Fine,SONOIO,2018,6.1,"On his third and final album as SONOIO, Alessandro Cortini of Nine Inch Nails combines the brooding intensity of Trent Reznor’s band with arena-rock melodies in the vein of U2 and Depeche Mode.
","For Alessandro Cortini, naming a solo project SONOIO feels like a conspiratorial wink. “Sonoio” means “it’s me” in his native tongue, Italian, and SONOIO is where he grants free reign to his personality, synthesizing everything that has come before it in his musical career. The tireless Cortini is a veteran of industrial pop giants Nine Inch Nails and New Order-ish emotionalists Modwheelmood, while under his own name he makes opulent ambient records that worship at the altar of the Buchla synthesizer.
Elements of all of these projects appear on Fine, his third and final SONOIO record. But, as might be expected of someone who spends his nights strapped to the NIN touring machine, their influence dominates. The album combines the brooding intensity and coiled aggression of Trent Reznor’s band with grandstanding arena-rock melodies that owe more to U2’s “big music” and Depeche Mode’s stadium-sized angst than to Skinny Puppy’s deviant thrash. By and large, these are the kind of solidly written, satisfyingly thick pop songs that would have Albuquerque row ZZ singing along; it’s easy to imagine Reznor bellowing out “Thanks for Calling” or “Bad Habit” on his latest Enormo-Dome trek.
Cortini, however, possesses neither Reznor’s aggressive authority nor Bono’s buffed-up emotional sincerity. His voice more closely resembles that of Sparks’ Russell Mael or Wild Beasts’ Hayden Thorpe, all quivering intensity and twitchy falsetto. When it works—as on the sunstroke ballad “What’s Before” and the electronic shoegaze track “Left”—this unlikely fusion of music and vocals creates a wonderfully dramatic hybrid that’s somewhat akin to the synth-pop foppery of John Maus’ recent album Screen Memories. At other times, though, the theatrical sheen undermines the songs’ emotional heft. A line like, “Thanks for calling/Thanks for letting me go,” from “Thanks For Calling,” might be a barbarous kiss-off when delivered by Trent Reznor. But Cortini sounds petulant, like a teen whining at parents who wouldn’t let him go to a party.
That the vocals sometimes grate is a shame, considering that the best moments on this album have the instrumental grace of Cortini’s eponymous synth work. “I Don’t Know (Coda)” rests on a subtly burbling TB-303 line—a surprisingly delicate use of an instrument too often employed for its shrieking impact—that trails off into a duet between machine and glockenspiel. “Bad Habit” has a nebulous synth sound that wobbles around like a tired toddler, in a throwback to the dreamy world of Sonno, a 2014 solo album that grew out of lullabies Cortini composed while on tour. This is Fine at its best, though even it could have done without the vocals.
“I Don’t Know (Coda)” provides a fitting end to SONOIO’s charming but underdeveloped run. Whereas NIN regularly leave stages slick with sweat and littered with broken keyboard parts, this agreeably noodling closer suggests that Cortini would return to sweep up any mess he’d made after the house lights came back on. SONOIO turns out to be the Nine Inch Nails you can take home to meet the parents: a pleasant diversion that may leave you craving more illicit excitement.

Mirror Traffic,Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks,2011,7.7,"Stephen Malkmus' Beck-produced Mirror Traffic possesses a relaxed, spontaneous feel befitting the Pavement frontman's earlier days.
","As we spend the next nine years critically dissecting and reassessing the 1990s, let's agree to make one historical revision: The lo-fi auteurs of the era-- your Malkmuses, your Pollards, your Elephant Sixers-- were not in fact ""slackers,"" despite the prevailing label/insult of the the day. Truthfully, their lack of studio polish was not a matter of laziness, ironic aesthetic, or poverty, but a coping mechanism for the unstoppable torrent of melodies, words, and ideas exploding from each songwriter's brain. No time for getting that song exactly right-- on to the next one.
That first-draft immediacy can fade with success, creative fatigue, or that demon ""maturity."" In the case of Malkmus, the transformation took the flavor of just wanting to play his damn guitar-- a mid-life crisis where sports cars were replaced with extended solos, ornate riffs, and long songs that felt even longer. But if the recent rash of alt-rock reunions were meant to cash in on audience nostalgia, perhaps some happy memories ricocheted back onto the bandleaders as they revisited their ragged, spontaneous greatest hits. To put it plainly, Mirror Traffic is not the time travel back to Pavement's peak that is the futile wish of every 30-something indie dork, but it is a rewind to a less perfectionist Malkmus, packed with the most mischief and weirdness he's displayed since his eponymous solo debut. It also has the most songs since Wowee Zowee. Like that declaration of independence from the confines of a successful band, Mirror Traffic possesses a relaxed, spontaneous feel befitting his earlier days in NoCal.
Despite originally wanting to title the album L.A. Guns and putting the hard-rocking ""Senator"" forward as the first single, Malkmus largely lays off the Guitar Hero: The fretboard theatrics are used more sparingly and deployed to much greater effect on ""Forever 28"" where a ""Mr. Blue Sky"" bounce is interrupted by Thin Lizzy runs, or in the thrilling summertime riff of ""Stick Figures in Love"". Only three songs break the five-minute barrier, and these feel far less claustrophobic than the extended tracks on the last three Jicks records. ""Share the Red""'s shambolic waltz, for instance, goes down easier than the 10-minute-long interlocking duets of ""Real Emotional Trash"".
Songs also move in unexpected directions, like the Go! Team-ish coda of ""No One Is (As I Are Be)"" or the slingshot tempo changes of ""Spazz"". Even a brief interstitial like ""Jumblegloss""-- with cosmic guitars and unidentifiable auditory objects whirring by-- is a refreshing bit of spontaneity to rinse after the album's most Jicks-like rocker, ""Brain Gallop"". The less serious vibe better suits Malkmus' still intact sense of humor and menagerie of oddballs (opening here with a nudist in Birkenstocks and ending 15 songs later with a cousin ""down with soft rap"").
Happily, celebrity producer Beck doesn't employ the heavy hand he showed earlier this year on Thurston Moore's Demolished Thoughts, which re-enacted Sea Change with the Sonic Youth frontman on vocals. Here, Beck's fingerprints are lighter-- he plays enabler to Malkmus' quirks, leaving in mid-vocal laughs, adding subtle lap-steel on ""Tigers"" and ""Long Hard Book"", and fuzzing out the punkish ""Spazz"" and ""Tune Grief"".
Whether he likes it or not, Malkmus is the indie-rock version of a Dylan or Simon or U2, artists who will forever be blurbed as making ""their best album since ____."" Competing with his younger self is definitely not a priority for Malkmus, who went through Pavement's reunion tour like he was punching a clock. Any resemblance to earlier days is likely unintentional, but for the aging hipsters of the world, even an accidental flashback is a good contact high. Mirror Traffic tickles that nostalgia without sacrificing maturity, discovering that ""playfully relaxed"" is a valid third route between ""slacker"" and ""manic.""

Real Emotional Trash,Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks,2008,6.8,"The most aesthetically cohesive album of Stephen Malkmus' career, Real Emotional Trash is also his jammiest-- an unabashedly rock'n'roll band album unafraid to stretch its songs past the 10-minute mark.
","The first line of Real Emotional Trash begs to be read autobiographically: ""Of all my stoned digressions/ Some have mutated into the truth/ Not a spoof."" It's the same tease that Malkmus pulled by calling his last album Face the Truth, in spite of its characteristically elusive contents. While that record featured Malkmus fully indulging his penchant for eclectic basement tinkering, Real Emotional Trash is an unabashedly rock'n'roll band album. It's the most aesthetically cohesive album of Malkmus' solo career (which is good), but also the jammiest (which, here, is bad). The record may sound like it would have been a blast to play on, but that doesn't always make for an engrossing listen.
On the plus side, Real Emotional Trash is still a Stephen Malkmus album, and it's host to all his pursuant charms and quirks. As a writer, Malkmus remains in top form; the album is rife with character-based songwriting that seems increasingly rare and valuable as songwriters increasingly grapple with overstated signifiers of sincerity. Even the album's title is characteristically apt-but-not-apt; though the material on Real Emotional Trash could hardly be considered straightforwardly ""emotional"" (even in comparison to Malkmus' output at large), there's a very real sense of excitement that comes from its communal sound.
The excitement is justified, too; these Jicks (Malkmus included) are stellar musicians. Malkmus shows off his band's strengths right off the bat; ""Dragonfly Pie"" is equal parts swaggering indie and 1970s AOR, coupling simple and memorable melodic phrases with synchronized, fuzzy guitar riffs. There are some moments of extreme understated structural elegance here; as the song's chorus emerges from a tangled verse, Sleater-Kinney/Quasi drummer (and now Jick) Janet Weiss' muscular and precise drumming lends the song a unified sense of purpose that's largely been absent from Malkmus' solo work.
Unfortunately, it doesn't last. Many of the songs on Real Emotional Trash start promising, but quickly become frustratingly repetitive and aimless. At times, the album veers satisfyingly into proggy excess or White Stripes-like forceful minimalism, but never commits to either. If anything, it sounds like the work of a band that knows how to play well together, but can't necessarily convey a purpose beyond that. ""Hopscotch Willie"" starts out with a pleasant verse (that actually brings to mind the melody from Sade's ""Smooth Operator""), but by the six-minute mark you're, uh, well aware that you've hit the six-minute mark.
The album drags even more with its title track, one of many on Real Emotional Trash that struggles to construct an epic from just a handful of memorable moments. The song’s extended midsection deftly shows off the band’s ability to work in tandem, but it's not a gesture that rewards repeat listens. Thankfully, the album picks up with lead single ""Baltimore"" and the under-three-minute, almost-""Reelin' in the Years""-quoting ""Gardenia"", both of which use the band’s strength to put some extra oomph into already-great songs. Closer ""Wicked Wanda"" is great, too, incorporating enough musical curveballs to keep things interesting.
Then again, ""Wicked Wanda"" is a fitting end for a record that is something of a curveball itself. Face the Truth overflowed with incongruous musical ideas, but Real Emotional Trash is determinedly unified, even if it isn't always clear to what ends. At its best, the record hints at opening a whole new musical world for Malkmus-- one in which his well-worn style is effectively played down in the service of a mighty rock'n'roll band. Otherwise, it's simply a satisfying, if underdeveloped, gesture towards something much greater than itself.

Face the Truth,Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks,2005,8.7,"On his third post-Pavement album, Stephen Malkmus recovers his youthful mien, seamlessly fusing his lanky, hammed-up guitar rock and the warm-hued air of ""sunset nostalgia"" it abets and a playful experimentation with electronic instrumentation.
","Story's textbook, at first: Boy comes home from college. Boy forms band. Boy's band drop a couple of startlingly great records. Boy doesn't seem to notice, and goes on waxing introspective as band's career seems more and more like a prematurely begun ride into the sunset. Boy dissolves band and stakes out on solo career, releasing a couple of startlingly MOR records, the merits of which are kinda halfheartedly debated-- by now, people have divested themselves emotionally of Boy. Somewhere along the line, Boy realizes he is no longer a boy. (Here's where it gets fuzzy.) Man discovers synthesizers and becomes, once again, gloriously, a boy. Excuse me: Boy.
Pardon the oversimplification, but that really seems to be what it took for Stephen Malkmus to recover his youthful mien. Face the Truth is SM's third solo album and his first to hold the line against the work of Pavement and Silver Jews. The album fuses seamlessly three distinct strains of his songwriting, which have jostled clumsily and often collided head-on throughout his career: The lanky, hammed-up guitar rock and the warm-hued air of ""sunset nostalgia"" it abets are nothing new; but Malkmus' playful experimentation with electronic instrumentation is a more recent phenomenon. Behind this happy clash of stylistic preferences is a subtly but surely revivified Malkmus, confident to experiment more deliberately than ever.
Experimentation, wha? If you're a Slanted & Enchanted devotee, you might read any stab at reinvention as a death knell-- even though you were probably bored to tears Malkmus' previous solo efforts, you crank. But Malkmus is underdog personified, and unlikely triumph was one of Pavement's key draws. Another was their ability to forge illusory stylistic coherence despite their records' actual heterogeneousness. Appropriately enough, Face the Truth is dizzyingly eclectic, tracing a haphazard arc and often working exactly when, where, and how it shouldn't. Opener ""Pencil Rot"" supernovas with a boxy, towering synthesizer that would sound at home in a Lil' Jon beat. In marked contrast are the track's whip-crack beat and rollicking, John Squire-referencing guitars. But rather than blend, Malkmus stacks, and the result is comfy sonic largess. Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain's ""Range Life"", which quotes the same Squire lick, sounds reedy by comparison.
From ""Pencil Rot"" the album leaps light years to album teaser ""It Kills"", which condenses Malkmus's jammy kick (see: Pig Lib's nine-minute ""1% of One"") into something infinitely more manageable-- a lightly swung pop song streaming with sinewy lines. The pilot ad for Face the Truth features an anachronistic female model, all seafoam green jumpsuit and sprayed-stiff coif, prostrate before the camera in a sexually self-servicing pose. As ""It Kills"" makes clear, the masturbatory insinuations aren't unintentional: Synths et al. aside, Face the Truth is, at its core, a great guitar record.
If ""It Kills"" is the fried egg squatting atop a bed of noodles, let ""No More Shoes"" stand for the whole Pho shop. Now, this sunset nostalgia business, I can see it getting pretty soporific if it weren't so well executed-- especially when stretched across an eight-minute, Kiss-quoting, free-soloing odyssey. Unlike ""1% of One"", however, here Malkmus drops a quick pilot verse and he's off. Fuck that check back in periodically crap, melody. You ain't my mom. ""No More Shoes"" rips for a full five minutes before returning to Earth, and when it does, it's changed. Espresso buzzing. Post-coital glowing. Ate-too-much tummy aching. A tousled Malkmus yowls like a scatological beat atop the entrails, before conceding one final verse. It's virtuosic, sure, but hardly wanky: Malkmus's guitar playing has matured from artful sloven to artful sloven capable of moments of electrifying spontaneity and elegantly verbose phrasing, much the way latter-day Sonic Youth have blossomed into punk Mozarts.
How better to follow Face the Truth's most musically longwinded number with its most lyrically concise? Malkmus's word play is generally more unabashed here than on Pig Lib, as witnessed by aforementioned ""Pencil Rot,"" which blithers in stream-of-(altered)-consciousness: ""I'm here to sing a song, a song about privilege/ The spikes you put on your feet when you were crawlin' and dancin' to the top of the human shit pile/ Shit pile."" But ""Mama"" forgoes the invisible ink, painting a bucolic family portrait at a canted angle: ""Mama's in the kitchen with onions/ Daddy's in the back with Old Hank/ Talkin' 'bout the lasers and bunions, talkin' disability rank/ No, we didn't have too much money."" I've omitted the last line in the sequence because, delivered in a brittle falsetto and matched to the Jicks' taut upbeat kicks, it's shatteringly beautiful, and I'd rather not spoil the moment by trying to decipher what's being said. Other highlights include the balls-out sloppy joe anthem ""Baby, C'mon"" and the soft-twinkling ""Freeze the Saints"", which is bathetic in the most charming way.
Face the Truth might serve as a first encounter for a young generation of Pavement-uninitiated. If that's the case, congrats. I'm genuinely excited for you. It gets even better from here. But I get the sense, also, that a growing contingent of Pavement's alpha fans find Malkmus' new millennium solo conquests excessive, watered down, sappy, old, etc. Well, fuck, aren't we a party pooper? The reason Malkmus remains so vital is because he's aged gracefully; his music shows none of the sagging flesh of existential panic. In fact, there's still a breeziness to it that, while not as spry and unvarnished as Pavement, bespeaks a man who has no illusions about his age: Thirty-eight is young, and if ""Oil Can"" Boyd can still throw a fastball, why can't one of his generation's greatest songwriters and his Jicks master a few new tricks?

Sparkle Hard,Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks,2018,8.0,"On his fetching seventh solo album, the witty and digressive songwriting of Stephen Malkmus becomes newly and delightfully grounded in the present day.
","Though Pavement’s sound and soul have been inextricably linked to the ’90s, Stephen Malkmus’ solo career feels unmoored to any era. Removed from the zeitgeist and any real commercial expectations, Malkmus has settled into a comfortable routine of indulging whims, exploring rabbit holes, and generally making music just far enough removed from Pavement’s buzzy aloofness that nobody could accuse him of chasing past glories. Give or take a Real Emotional Trash, the approach has flattered him.
So perhaps the most surprising thing about his fetching seventh album, Sparkle Hard, is how of-the-moment it feels. It engages with the present in a way none of his Jicks albums have, time-stamping its songs with lyrics about Facebook and nods to the Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements (“Men are scum, I won’t deny,” he sings). On several songs, he even toys around with vocal manipulation and Auto-Tune. He doesn’t go full Frank Ocean or Bon Iver or anything, but it’s a tantalizing taste of the kind of music Malkmus might be making if he were a quarter-century younger.
Malkmus possesses a delightful sense of ease and unpredictability here. “Solid Silk” is caressed by warm strings right out of a ’70s Philly soul record. On the country lark “Refute,” Kim Gordon swings by for a verse that slyly reimagines the circumstances of her very public divorce; her poker face and his smirk play off of each other so flatteringly that it’s amazing she and Malkmus have never worked together before. In general, Malkmus’ words are flowing off his tongue even more seamlessly than usual. “You know you should be blushin’ to a hue of Robitussin,” he hums on “Middle America,” a gorgeous doodle of a song.
The album doesn’t skimp on rippers, either. Malkmus has cut back on the guitar theatrics over his last few records, but when he deploys them, he makes them come alive. Slathered in unruly fuzz, “Shiggy” rides a beaming riff that grows more jubilant by the minute. And then there’s “Bike Lane,” which juxtaposes news of a bike lane with the violent death of Freddie Gray at the hands of the police. “They got behind him with their truncheons and choked the life right out of him,” Malkmus sings, accompanied by a chugging krautrock rhythm. It may be the most confrontational song he’s ever written.
The Wowee Zowee standout “Grounded,” with its protest that “boys are dying on these streets,” was also a plea for caring, but it directed its jabs at the detached upper class, with their luxury sedans and crystal ice picks. Here Malkmus is poking at his own bubble, the socially aware middle class that presumably makes up much of his audience these days—the ones that back Black Lives Matter on paper, but tend to get a lot more worked up about issues that affect their daily commute. “Bike Lane” is the rare Malkmus song that demands you to wrestle with it. Is it even in good taste? Malkmus is low on the list of artists anybody wanted to hear tell Freddie Gray’s story, and his voice is far too glib for the subject matter. But at least he’s saying his name, and that’s more than most indie-rock records do.
Sparkle Hard is not ostensibly different than his last couple albums, but its arrival feels better timed—there’s been a hole in the market for indie-rock albums this impervious, compact, and good-natured. Where Malkmus’ solo work has sometimes walked the fine line between too detached or too self-satisfied, the record cartwheels over it with the assurance of an artist who’s correctly assumed that so long as he’s enjoying himself enough, others will too.

Wig Out at Jagbags,Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks,2014,7.0,"Most of Stephen Malkmus' newest solo effort, Wig Out at Jagbags, sounds like 70s guitar-rock rendered as some kind of ergonomic desk toy: compact, brightly colored, unlikely to stir the depths of the soul but nifty nevertheless. He's never resisted age but has never seemed younger.
","By now, Stephen Malkmus has released more music as a solo artist than he did with his old band Pavement. This might surprise people like me, who given a few beers and a tolerant audience will still lapse into vague, sentimental reminiscences about seeing Pavement in late 1999, a few weeks before Malkmus got onstage in Brixton with handcuffs around his mic stand, telling the audience—in a rare moment of disclosure—that the cuffs were a symbol. This, it turns out, is how a poet breaks up a band.
In retrospect, their breakup marked a moment when indie-rock's narrative started moving away from the sloppy, casual grace of the 90s toward bands like the Strokes and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, who wore tighter jeans, had more conventional sex appeal, and played like there was something at stake. The irrelevance of Malkmus's solo career was a foregone conclusion.
All things considered, he's taken it well, turning out albums at a regular clip, none of them exceptional but none bad either—and crucially, none that suggest that he's fixated on the past. They're fussier than Pavement albums, with intricate guitar parts and carnival-like shifts in rhythm that Pavement would have either found too showy or just too much of a chore to play. There's more focus on the fineries of production and arrangement, too. (You won't find trombones on Pavement albums.)  They're also goofier, which some listeners might find awesome, but I find a little annoying. Free from the intensities of being pretty much any age under 30, he now seems like what his critics always claimed he was as Pavement wore on into the late 90s: A smart dude horsing around.
I listen to these albums with a kind of passing happiness, surprised by how easily Malkmus can still make me smile, vaguely saddened by the idea that a smile is probably the most complex emotional response he'll get from me. Wig Out at Jagbags isn't all that different in spirit from 2011's Mirror Traffic, which is to say that it's less jammy and long-winded than either Real Emotional Trash or Pig Lib but essentially the product of the same mischievous brain. Most of it sounds sort of like 70s guitar-rock rendered as some kind of ergonomic desk toy: compact, brightly colored, unlikely to stir the depths of the soul but nifty nevertheless.
If Malkmus' post-Pavement career deserves more—or more serious—credit, it's for introducing a persona that hasn't really existed before: Male without the tediously burdened spirit of masculinity, arty but not pretentious, sensitive but too good-natured to make a fuss when his feelings got hurt. Even in Pavement days he was regarded as a kind of golden boy—the sweet liberal-arts alternative to Kurt Cobain, the stoner diarist beloved by jocks in part because he was everything they assumed stoner diarists weren't: funny, low-key, averse to competition but still knowledgeable about sports. ""We were raised on Tennyson and venison and the Grateful Dead,"" he sings on ""Lariat"". This is the Malkmus of both Jagbags and Mirror Traffic: Steeped in Victorian poetry but still knows his way around a grill.
And as with  Mirror Traffic, Jagbags is obliquely concerned with aging. ""I don't have the stomach for your brandy, I can hardly sip your tea,"" he sings on the slow-burning ""Independence Street"". ""I don't have the teeth left for your candy/ I'm just busy being free."" Later come the lines, ""Shanghai'd in Oregon/ Cinnamon and lesbians/ The power lines revolt in time / I've been tripping my face off since breakfast/ taking in this windswept afternoon."" Malkmus is 47 now, closer to getting his AARP card than to graduating college. Once the wistful 25 year old with a heart full of unspeakable sentiments, now he's the handsome middle-aged guy next door borrowing a pinch of weed to get him through this cookie-baking session for his son's end-of-the-season soccer party. He has never resisted age but has never seemed younger, and in the occasional la-la-la still shimmers with the charm of a boy.
At the heart of his music is still an inimitable bittersweetness—the light shrug that follows the realization that in time all things will die and pass. His best songs have always felt like ballads, regardless of tempo. There are some of those songs here: ""Lariat"", ""Houston Hades"", ""Independence Street."" But the sweetest and bitterest moment is near the end of ""Rumble at the Rainbo"", a two-minute rave-up that starts like a mock-punk throwaway and ends on the line, ""Can you remember the thrill and the rush? You're not out of touch. Come tonight you'll see: No one here has changed and no one ever will."" The performance is stupid and flamboyant, a duckwalk across a stage that only exists in his mind. Anyway, he was probably kidding. But as with most modest hearts, his best jokes have always been the ones he tells at his own expense.

Native Invader,Tori Amos,2017,7.5,"One of pop’s most inventive composers returns with a braid of political, maternal, and celestial statements. On Native Invader, Amos’ intricately arranged songs are passionate and despairingly poetic.
","For much of Tori Amos’ solo career, the piano-thrashing composer and singer has navigated the porous membrane between the personal and the political—the starkly searing depiction of sexual assault “Me and a Gun,” her waking-nightmare flip of Eminem’s murder lullaby “97 Bonnie and Clyde,” the Trail of Tears eulogy “Scarlet’s Walk.” On her heady, fever-dreamy 15th album Native Invader, Amos adds a third element, bringing in the increasingly strip-mined Earth as both imperiled muse and guiding light. The self, the ever-more-chaotic agora, and the physical world triangulate in a way that allows Amos to take all of them on at once, and to create a despairingly poetic, chillingly vital album that channels its depictions of humanity’s horrors through intricately arranged songs.
As this unjust year burrows deeper into our psyches, the space to think, to create, to just exist as oneself becomes ever more precious. Amos knows this; “Embedded in this record are energy forces, hopefully, that create a space—space to step into from the cacophony of the news cycle,” Amos told Lenny about Native Invader. The album is spacious and enveloping even as it warns of horrors down the line. The wraithlike “Wings” uses sparse electronics to cradle Amos’ exacting mezzo-soprano, while the broken-relationship chronicle “Chocolate Song” see-saws between brittle instrumentation on its verses and simmering organ lines on the chorus. The imagery of nature’s most beautiful creations, which encompass shooting stars as well as selfless women (the sighing “Climb” calls out repeatedly to Saint Veronica, who offered her veil to Jesus Christ while he was on his march toward crucifixion), further cements the album’s connections to the celestial and the maternal.
Amos is one of pop’s most inventive composers and lyricists, and her twinned skills allow the political content on Native Invader to float where others may sink. “Up the Creek,” which features Amos' daughter Tash on backing vocals, pivots on a refrain passed down to Amos from her Cherokee grandfather during her childhood in Maryland: “Good lord willin' and the creek don't rise,” the pair sing in spectral harmony. That line reverberates throughout the track as the music gets more clamorous and the lyrics more urgent, with Amos declaring “We may just survive/If the Militia of the Mind/Arm against those climate blind” as strings churn underneath her. The spiraling “Bats” and the coy “Benjamin” are paired at the record’s end, with the titular animals in the former possessing the knowledge of being “betrayed by humankind,” and the latter doubling as a warning about fossil fuel companies’ ever-extending tentacles into the public sphere—particularly their fusillade of propaganda against Juliana vs. United States, in which the country and its rulers were sued by 21 plaintiffs for “deliberately allow[ing] atmospheric CO2 concentrations to escalate to levels unprecedented in human history.” The piano lament “Russia,” included on the album’s deluxe edition, is an anomaly; lyrics like “Is Stalin on your shoulder?” and “Time to face those who take/More and more from our great Mother” make the themes of the album uncomfortably plain, although whether that unease comes from the lyrics’ explicitness or the situation they’re describing is a toss-up.
”Mary’s Eyes,” which closes the album, threads Native Invader’s needle; over drones and bleakly insistent piano, Amos sings of an unknowable mother who is clearly suffering, with “hymns locked in her memory” that can possibly be unlocked by patterns and sequences, and banishing sadness. It’s about Amos’ mother Mary, who lost the ability to speak in the wake of a stroke she had earlier this year. But the pain that suffuses Amos’ passionate vocal performance and the warnings of climate change doom that preceded that track make it feel like it’s doubling as an allegory for the mother Earth, which cannot raise its voice in self-defense even as it’s being hurtled toward a crushing fate.

Little Earthquakes / Under the Pink,Tori Amos,1992/2015,8.6,"These reverently remastered editions of Little Earthquakes and Under the Pink, the first two solo records by Tori Amos, show the singer-songwriter discovering how to obey her compositional muse and harness her prodigious gifts into a singular voice. The legacy of these milestones linger over today’s underground, and others all wear their sensitivities as strengths as she did.
","Myra Ellen Amos got used to dazzling and perplexing adults early on. At age 5 she became the youngest-ever student to enroll at Johns Hopkins University’s Peabody Institute. At 11, she was thrown out due to her inability to sight-read as well as she could play by ear. At 13, she started performing at Washington, D.C.’s piano bars, some of them gay, where—chaperoned by her pastor dad in his clerical collar—she’d take requests and try out her own material. And by 24, she tasted failure when her band Y Kant Tori Read released one Pat Benatar-esque 1988 album that instantly flopped as though it had never even existed.
Being misrepresented on its cover as a sword-wielding, flame-haired metal vixen forced Amos to take control of her image while struggling to satisfy expectations that her prodigious genius generated.  (""I had come from child prodigy to 'vapid bimbo,' "" she told Rolling Stone in 2009.) Still contracted to Atlantic Records, she paired with former singer-songwriter Davitt Sigerson, and then with paramour Eric Rosse, but the label nixed both batches of results. So Amos kept on writing and recording, streamlining her music until a tearful viewing of Thelma & Louise prompted a song that didn’t need any accompaniment whatsoever. After ""Me and a Gun"", no suit dared argue that her album wasn’t finished.
Whereas nearly all of her songs invite interpretation, this one is unquestionably about Amos getting raped. She changed a few details: Her real-life attacker wielded not a gun but a knife, and demanded that his victim sing hymns while he violated her. In the song, Amos mimics simple regimented intervals learned from psalms. Abruptly she breaks free from this steady keel as if mirroring how her psyche detaches from her body in order to deal with what’s happening to her. ""Do you know Carolina where the biscuits are soft and sweet?"" she suddenly wails with startling force before returning to the song's melodic core to explain, ""These things go through your head when there’s a man on your back and you’re pushed flat on your stomach.""
This snapped Atlantic to its senses. Drawn almost exclusively from the initial reject pile, Little Earthquakes finally appeared in early 1992, right when Nirvana’s Nevermind topped the charts. Amos’ solo debut, though it was rarely talked about this way, was similarly radical—an alternately flirty and harrowing work that juxtaposed barbed truths against symphonic flights of fancy. It was lyrically nuanced and harmonically sophisticated exactly when grunge moved rock in a raw and brutish direction, which made her achievement even more striking. Amos was early Queen, early Elton John, and early Kate Bush with Rachmaninoff chops. Decades after prog-rock’s peak, her technical perfection was particularly shocking in the virtuoso-renouncing '90s: Not even Elton could tear into a song both vocally and instrumentally while staring down attendees with a Cheshire Cat grin.
She did (and still does) this by straddling her piano bench like a lover with one foot pumping pedals and the other beating time, as if sending out long-suppressed erotic urges directly through her music, right at her audience. Listen to the live B-sides sequenced together at the end of each bonus disc that joins these reverently remastered editions of Little Earthquakes and Under the Pink, and you’ll hear this carnal communion evolve: At first her delivery is slightly mannered, and the crowd’s dead silent. But by the second disc, she’s flowing freely, and her following screams ecstatically in kind.
*Earthquakes *chronicles a woman coming to terms with post-traumatic stress disorder. As she’d much later explore on 2007’s American Doll Posse, Amos had split her psyche into separate personas so she could deal with the pressure of being a both a minister’s daughter and prodigy. On this album, Amos finds her truest primary voice, no more so than on her inaugural U.S. single, ""Silent All These Years"", which chronicles that discovery in real time.
It was here that she discovered how to obey her compositional muse: Establish a theme, wander from it, and then return via pop’s reassuring verse/chorus/verse structure. Amos would soon drift much, much further from her motifs, but here she’s uncommonly focused: The song’s circling introduction references her conservatory roots by evoking practice exercises, yet it’s catchy, and the bluntest moments in the melody fall exactly when Amos sings the title, a reliable songwriter’s trick.
Yet even in the singer’s most accessible song, idiosyncrasies abound: From intro to opening verse, the tempo slows drastically, and remains irregular. Her right hand on the piano doesn’t always sync with what her left is doing and often accentuates different beats, while her lyric references Satan and menstruation amidst soothing classical filigree. ""Sometimes, I said, sometimes I hear my voice,"" she sings in a tone occasionally irked but ultimately joyful: Her real self, muted since childhood, finally comes out to play.
For the outsider women and gay men who initially propelled Amos’ success, this hard-won message served as a clarion call, and they embraced her as if uncovering the challenging and most vulnerable parts of themselves. Tracy Chapman, Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, k.d. lang, Sinéad O'Connor, and the Indigo Girls had already begun to reach the same flock, but Amos—by virtue of her sexual intensity and subject matter—instantly commanded a bond only rivaled by Madonna, whose eroticism peaked just as Amos arrived. ""Look, I’m standing naked before you/ Don’t you want more than my sex,"" she teased in ""Leather"" over strutting chords that recall Queen’s ""Killer Queen"". Like Madonna, Amos put earthly passions on display not necessarily to seduce her congregation, but to empower herself—and, by extension—her fans.
The difference between '94’s Under the Pink and its predecessor was that by this time Amos had sold enough to keep Atlantic execs at bay. In their absence, she and Rosse accentuated the orchestral pomp on some tracks while shrewdly deviating from it on others. Whereas she’d flatly rejected previous requests to replace Little Earthquakes’ pianos with guitars, here she fits in a few fleetingly noisy ones and bolsters the beat until it grooves.
These adjustments transformed Amos from rising singer-songwriter to major alt-rock upstart: ""Cornflake Girl""—the cartwheeling UK hit that preceded the album and showcases one of her spunkiest solos—helped Pink enter the UK chart at #1, while ""God""—the grousing, gnarly U.S. single—topped modern rock playlists. It’s nice that Sam Smith and Hozier subvert the religious overtones of their churchy presentations with orthodoxy-slamming videos, but both lack the clarity and courage of Amos chanting, ""God sometimes you just don’t come through.""
The rest wasn’t as pointed as that, but Pink’s extroverted arrangements worked as hard as Earthquakes’ lyrics and melodies. Amidst other overseas hits like ""Pretty Good Year"", Amos dug deeper, particularly on ""Bells for Her"", which suggests a ghost pirouetting across John Cage’s prepared piano. The pitch on certain keys is way off, like an old upright in your grandparents’ basement, but the effect is finessed the way Jimi Hendrix bent notes from music to cacophony and back again. ""Can’t stop what’s coming,"" she moans repeatedly while refusing to name her subject. Adulthood? The rupture of a childhood friendship? Orgasm? Amos’ mysteriousness sometimes subsequently got the best of her, but here she masters it.
Before, during, and immediately after these breakthroughs, Amos generated enough outtakes, covers, remixes, and live tracks to fill several UK and U.S. variations on each album’s many singles and EPs, all of them designed to generate enough sales from devotees to force radio’s hand. Here, on generous bonus discs, they flow like autonomous albums; the Earthquakes addendum favors tracks Amos and Atlantic dropped in search of an ideal launch, while the Pink supplement emphasizes the singer’s knack for reinventing her material on the fly.
Leading with a disc-long alternate version of Earthquakes, Amos’ 2006 box set A Piano: The Collectio**n already argued that ""Upside Down"" and ""Flying Dutchman""—both Sigerson-produced, string-wrapped efforts—equaled most everything that made the cut. Here, those fan favorites better complement Amos’ impulsive material, like ""Sweet Dreams"", which rewrites David Bowie’s ""Panic in Detroit"" as a Gallic jig, and ""The Pool"", an eerie excursion in extended overdubbed vocal tones that proved Amos boasted the harmonic chops to become a credible avant-garde classical composer. As her many cover versions attest, Amos honed discerning interpretive skills in her piano-bar adolescence: Her eerily funereal 1992 treatment of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" gently accentuates Kurt Cobain’s desperation while showcasing her exquisite phrasing. Check her timing and dynamics, the way she estranges his melody by pulling buried notes from chords while riding her sustain pedal and then releasing it as if drawing a breath. Even when she holds back, as she does here, Amos seethes.
Pink’s outtakes aren’t generally as memorable as Earthquakes’: Aside from her ominous ""Honey"", an eleventh-hour omission she’s said she regrets, the Pink B-sides explore the same mesmeric side of Amos’ songbook as the album’s long and winding ballads. The seven live tracks, however, affirm that Amos could pull more drama from one acoustic piano than ordinary bands draw from several amplified instruments, and not just on the hits. ""Here. In My Head"", a feather-light flip she also admits should’ve been on Pink, gets the knockout climax its studio incarnation denies, while ""Winter""—her disciplined and devastating invocation of childhood’s paradise lost—gets elevated to the level of ""Me and a Gun"", as Amos emotionally amplifies and musically fleshes out every quietly anguished second. It’s astounding.
Tori Amos arrived in an era when an unconventional, confrontational artist could also be commercial. Both Earthquakes and Pink went double-platinum in the U.S., and although American Top 40 radio never accommodated her, Amos managed to generate modern rock, adult contemporary, and dance club hits for 10 solid years before settling into cult-heroine status. Naturally, others came to wear her crown of anomalies and thorns: Lana Del Rey remains the sole mainstream act to adroitly juxtapose and underplay personal trauma with classical finery, yet the legacy of these milestones linger over today’s underground: Sufjan Stevens, Bat for Lashes, John Grant, Lykke Li, Owen Pallett, St. Vincent, Perfume Genius, FKA twigs, Antony Hegarty, and others all wear their sensitivities as strengths as she did. Effervescent, but at this peak still grounded by adversity, Amos taught her strange children well.

The Asylum Era,Tom Waits,1973,8.7,"These first seven albums constitute the first act of Waits’ remarkable career, even as these reissues complicate that journey from assembly-line singer-songwriter to eclectic iconoclast.
","Tom Waits had one of the wildest trajectories of any rock artist in the 1970s—or possibly ever. A regular presence in San Diego’s coffeehouse folk scene in the late 1960s, he was living out of his car when Herb Cohen, the manager for the Mothers of Invention and Linda Ronstadt, discovered him and helped to secure a record deal with the fledgling Asylum Records. David Geffen and Elliot Roberts had just opened the label in 1971, but already it was a home to some of Southern California’s finest singer-songwriters, including Jackson Browne, Judee Sill, Joni Mitchell, and Neil Young. Waits was plugged as a like-minded artist, based on songs like “Martha” (covered by Tim Buckley) and “Ol’ 55” (covered by labelmates the Eagles).
As the decade progressed, Waits grew weirder and woolier, indulging his penchant for weapons-grade schmaltz as well as his fascination with Beat jazz and the seedier byways of Los Angeles. With each album his voice curdled more deeply into a whiskey growl, often sounding like Louis Armstrong after a bender. His songs sprawled into strange recitations about gutter characters: strippers and barflies, hucksters and grifters, vagrants holding up lampposts and waitresses slinging hash. During it all, Waits maintained strict control over his craft—his music rarely seems haphazard—but bent his songs into new shapes to portray characters and convey emotions that didn’t have much of an outlet in pop music at the time. If his peers and labelmates were Laurel Canyon, Waits was the more sordid Tropicana Motel.
Waits’ current label, Anti-, is reissuing his first seven records, first on CD and on LP over the next few months, chronicling his time at Asylum. Newly remastered but without any bonus material, they form something like a road trip through an America that maybe never existed except in Waits’ own head, or perhaps a novel about an artist defining himself against pretty much every major trend. However, just because they show Waits getting comfortable in his own skin and learning how he could present himself to his fans, these albums comprise more than simply a prelude to his remarkable run of records in the 1980s and 1990s. These seven albums constitute the first act of a remarkable career, even as these reissues complicate that trajectory from assembly-line singer-songwriter to eclectic iconoclast.
Let’s back this Cadillac up a bit. While his teenage friends were playing psychedelic rock and protest pop, a young Tom Waits was discovering his parents’ record collection of big bands and crooners. He got more out of Bing Crosby than he did from the heavy guitar rock coming out of California at the time, but when he started performing, he was a folkie by necessity: He couldn’t afford a band, and coffeehouses were the only venues that would offer him a stage. Many of the songs on his 1973 debut Closing Time were written when Waits was making the rounds in San Diego, like “Ol’ 55,” an ode to the car that carries him away from his girlfriend’s bed on an early morning. It’s the only song with any daylight on this otherwise night-owl collection that’s set in bars and walk-ups and incorporating language he heard eavesdropping while working the door at the Heritage, a folk club on San Diego’s Mission Beach.
These are some of Waits’ most composed songs, the ones that hew closest to popular forms and structures. That’s not a criticism; this is just one melodic, highly structured mode that made these songs coverable by folk singers and shitty country-rock bands. They’re also some of his most focused songs: “I Hope That I Don’t Fall in Love With You” is an ode to missed opportunities, Waits never leaving his stool to tell the story of two strangers who never become anything more. Tender in its depiction of the low and the lonesome, the song is his first glimpse of this barroom milieu, which he would explore much more fully on subsequent albums. It might have sold poorly, but Closing Time reveals an artist who was obviously more than just another SoCal singer-songwriter.
Released in late 1974, The Heart of Saturday Night represents a significant step forward, with Waits inching closer to his signature setting and sound. It’s a concept album about the American Saturday Night and the sense of freedom or obligation or possibility contained in those hours. He’s not interested in the sinner-saint/Saturday night-Sunday morning dichotomies; the morals associated with organized religion have very rarely informed his lyrics. Rather, his characters are motivated by something ineffable, unnameable: “Tell me, is it the crack of the pool balls, neon buzzin’?” he asks of no one in particular on the title track. “Is it the barmaid that’s smilin’ from the corner of her eye? Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye?” Everybody wants a little romance, a little drama, a little signal that all these late nights and early mornings, dive bars and cheap beers, desperate glances and furtive hookups might actually add up to something like a worthwhile life.
Waits captures the melancholy but not exactly the excitement that Bruce Springsteen (his elder by two months) was conjuring in his similarly jazzy, relentlessly loquacious compositions around the same time. But the Boss exuded youth and all the promise contained therein; he was an optimist, a believer in the redemptive powers of rock’n’roll. Waits sounded old before his time, his voice deepening into a growl and his characters sloshing in their resignation. He was 25 going on 70 as he sang “San Diego Serenade,” his most bittersweet break-up ballad.
Elsewhere, he just sounds out of time. The Jazz Age saw a brief resurgence in the 1970s, thanks to movies like The Great Gatsby and novels like E.L. Doctorow’s Ragtime, but those works depict America as a font of wealth, luxury, and frivolity. For Waits, jazz conveyed deprivation and poverty, down-and-outers making the most of a few bucks and getting by on gumption and ingenuity. He convened a small band behind him, some sessions musicians who’d played for Ella Fitzgerald and Count Basie, among others. They lend “Diamonds on My Windshield” and “Fumblin’ With the Blues” a rhythmic elasticity, a Spartan quality that reflects the details of Waits’ world as ably and as convincingly as his lyrics do.
Waits took to the road, extending his persona to the stage and refining it in front of often hostile audiences who didn’t know the Tropicana Motel from the Chateau Marmont. His third album, Nighthawks at the Diner, benefits from those experiences even if it doesn’t really reflect them. It’s a live album, but only sort of. Waits and producer Bones Howe assembled a small audience of friends at the Record Plant in L.A., rolled out a piano and a microphone, and let Waits bend their ears for a few hours. It’s not a real nightclub, more like a Hollywood film set. He introduces it as “Raphael’s Silver Cloud Lounge,” then dives into a superlatively loose set that blurs the lines between song and stage banter. Where does his intro end and “Emotional Weather Report” begin? Is the eleven-minute “Nighthawk Postcards (From Easy Street)” a real song or just a long aside to the audience?
Nighthawks offers the best glimpse of Waits’ world so far, and what’s remarkable is the keen detail, the rich observations, and the sly turns of phrase. A street is full of “used car salesmen dressed up in Purina checkerboard slacks and Foster Grant wraparounds.” Eyeballing a smoky barroom he sees, “Stratocasters slung over the Burgermeister beer guts, and the swizzle-stick legs jackknifed over Naugahyde stools.” Few songwriters make such a meal of proper nouns. Waits has a hundred different ways to describe the moon in the night sky and a thousand different ways to describe a taxicab. One is “piss yellow,” another “bastard amber Velveeta yellow.” To see those words on a page is one thing; to hear Waits deliver them in his Satchmo growl—adjusting his cadence with the timing of a stand-up comedian, deploying the word “Velveeta” like a raunchy punchline—is something else entirely. This live/not live album is a pivotal release for Waits, one that demonstrates the depth of his world and the extent of his dedication to evoking it in fine, eccentric clarity.
To distance himself even further from what he perceived to be the popular image of the rock star, Waits traveled from one show to the next in a jalopy, stayed in fleabags instead of luxury hotels. Rather than coke and heroin, he indulged a vice more in fitting with the world he depicted: booze. Even by his own admission, Waits drank a lot—much more than this persona he was adopting demanded. That friction between him and the industry he had reluctantly joined is the theme, sometimes subtle and occasionally not subtle at all, running through his fourth album, Small Change.
The milieu is familiar, but he makes it all sound fantastical. “The Piano Has Been Drinking (Not Me)” is another song that sounds like it was recorded at 3 a.m. in a bar, but what sets it apart is how Waits presents the setting as nearly surreal: “The piano has been drinking, my necktie is asleep,” he observes from his bench. “The telephone’s out of cigarettes, and the balcony is on the make.” It sounds like the world he has carefully crafted on his first three albums is unraveling at its seams. “Pasties and a G-String” de-eroticizes its low-rent burlesque as a phantasmagoria of despair and boredom. Even “Step Right Up,” with Waits playing the carnival barker on some seedy midway, turns advertising slogans into dark magic.
As wiseacre and rambunctious as that particular song may be, Small Change is electrically charged with a pathos that comes across as both false and real, with Waits playing the raconteur masking his very real sadness behind expressions of sadness. “Bad Liver and a Broken Heart” launches a counteroffensive against his congenital sentimentality, as he slyly undercuts his own pieties: “The moon ain’t romantic, it’s intimidating as hell,” he crows. Deeply embedded in the underbelly, Small Change is nevertheless Waits’ most personal, even is most confessional album, somehow refracting the real person through the persona.
It didn’t take much for Small Change to outsell Waits’ previous albums, and it finally established him as an artist who could headline instead of support. Over the next few years, he would tour elaborate productions that occasionally incorporated fake snow and stage props. He used a cash register as percussion for “Step Right Up” (foreshadowing the pots-and-pans percussion on 1983’s Swordfishtrombones). Now that he had established his particular sound, Waits set about exploring it thoroughly over the next three albums, making slight adjustments and tinkering with various sounds and styles. Strings became more and more prominent, especially on 1977’s Foreign Affairs. Waits’ fifth begins with an instrumental called “Cinny’s Waltz,” which acts as a Technicolor overture for the songs that follow.
The tracks are austere, usually just Waits and a piano. Still, these are some of Waits’ most cinematic compositions, both musically and lyrically. “I Never Talk to Strangers,” a duet with Bette Midler, sounds like a rehash of “I Hope That I Don’t Fall in Love With You,” and “A Sight for Sore Eyes” plumbs the same nostalgia as “Martha,” among other songs. But Waits stretches out on the album’s second side, spinning wild yarns about hitmen and hitchhikers.
Waits always borrowed heavily from Hollywood, not only its grandiose soundtracks but also its neglected glamour and noir tableaux. In 1978, he took his first role in Sylvester Stallone’s Paradise Alley, as a piano player named Mumbles. It wasn’t a stretch; the character was based loosely on him to begin with. Later, “I Never Talk to Strangers” would inspire Francis Ford Coppola to write and direct 1981’s One from the Heart. So it’s fitting that Waits opens Blue Valentine with “Somewhere,” from Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim’s West Side Story. The song, like the musical, began onstage but was soon translated to the big screen, which parallels the trajectory Waits himself was taking. It must have seemed like an odd cover choice at the time, and Waits gives an odd performance by rounding his vowels and flattening the ends of his words into hisses and moans.
On the other hand, “Somewhere” makes perfect sense thematically: His characters may be hard up, but they’re still dreaming about that promised “place for us.” “Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis,” a minor hit at the time and a fan favorite for decades after, is one of Waits’ most devastating tunes. He sings in the voice of the title character as she describes a happy life to an old friend: She’s married and off the dope, pregnant and hopeful. Someone might have stolen her record player, but “I think I’m happy for the first time since my accident.” The last verse arrives like a punch in the gut, as she admits she’s making it all up before asking to borrow some dough.
That Minnesota sex worker may be Waits’ richest character, a dreamer who spins an elaborate yarn that even she doesn’t have the heart to maintain. If women have stayed at the margins of his world, usually playing strippers and molls and closing-time hook-ups and more generally serving as fuel for his very masculine sentimentality, here Waits gives a woman a starring role and manages to create a deeply complex and contradictory character. His voice might sound low and gruff, but his performance isn’t mannered or distracting. Rather, he’s deeply sympathetic, especially as he reveals her very modest dream: “I wish I had all the money we used to spend on dope,” he muses. “I’d buy me a used car lot and I wouldn’t sell any of ‘em. I’d just drive a different car everyday dependin’ on how I feel.”
In the context of Waits’ nearly fifty-year career, 1980’s Heartattack and Vine is often discussed as a transitional album, a pivot away from the jazzier settings of his Asylum records and toward a much wilder and weirder mode. And certainly there are clear signposts pointing the directions he would head in the new decade. But in the context of this reissue series, Heartattack and Vine sounds less like a transition and more like a goodbye to those back alleys and underbellies, those barrooms and speakeasies that he once inhabited so easily. On subsequent records that setting would be much less prominent, so it’s fitting that “In Shades” is an instrumental, a smooth, organ-led interlude saturated with nightclub chatter and silverware clatter. Waits himself is missing from the milieu, as though he has fled the scene already. And he ends the album with “Ruby’s Arms,” one of his tenderest compositions. It’s his goodbye to a lover he leaves before the sun comes up, something like a prequel to “Ol’ 55” that brings everything full circle. But it’s also a goodbye to every barfly and every hoodlum and every itinerant on some “inebriational travelogue” he’s met along the way. “I will leave behind all of my clothes I wore when I was with you,” he sings. And then he ends the album with a fond farewell as he rides off into the sunrise: “As I say goodbye… I’ll say goodbye.”
Bon voyage, as well, to the grizzled persona he inhabited throughout the 1970s. No longer a cult figure, he had become what you could reasonably call successful, the music industry bending to him rather than him accommodating its demands. But perhaps the most significant change—the one that really took him out of himself—came in 1978, on the set of Paradise Alley, when Waits met screenwriter Kathleen Brennan. In addition to becoming his songwriting partner, she inspired him to sober up and to expand the sound and scope of his music. “I didn’t just marry a beautiful woman,” he told The Guardian in 2006. ”I married a record collection.” He would never again be quite as prolific as he was in the 1970s—seven albums in seven years—but he would never again be truly alone again in a song.

Bad as Me,Tom Waits,2011,8.1,"Featuring contributions from longtime bandleader Marc Ribot, Keith Richards, and Flea, among others, Bad as Me is Tom Waits' first proper collection of studio material since 2004's Real Gone. He doesn't veer from his established sound, but the songwriting is as strong as ever.
","Back when The Old, Weird America, Greil Marcus' expansive treatise on Bob Dylan's 1967 collaboration with the Band, was first published in hardcover in 1997 (the same year, incidentally, that Smithsonian Folkways reissued Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music), it was called Invisible Republic. It was an apt, even poignant title that still never managed to evoke half the wistfulness its paperback replacement did. Marcus' disciples quickly rallied around the new phrase, adopting it as a kind of credo, a genre, and an aspirational aesthetic that owed as much to Robert Frank and Jack Kerouac as it did to Charley Patton and the Carter Family.  And while collective cultural nostalgia (for times real or imagined) has become part of the zeitgeist, longing for a dusty and peculiar past-- for the misbegotten and the unfussed-with, the archaic and the odd-- isn't a particularly new phenomenon. Marcus sought and found those things in pre-war vernacular American music, in the songs Smith culled from his crates of 78s and gathered under a Celestial Monochord. Tom Waits hears them everywhere.
Bad as Me is Waits' first proper collection of studio material since 2004's Real Gone (in 2006, he released Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers & Bastards, a 3xCD mélange of lost-and-found tracks). He's backed by a cabal of familiar, gnarly-faced noisemakers (David Hildalgo, longtime bandleader Marc Ribot, Keith Richards, Flea), and again shares writing and producing credit with his wife and frequent collaborator Kathleen Brennan. Waits' jerky grandpa bark, which he'd honed and perfected by his mid-twenties, was reverse-engineered to age well. Now, perhaps freed from the burden of approximation, he sounds especially wild and gleeful, hollering with deranged aplomb. Bad as Me is as essential-- and as essentially weird-- as anything he's done before.
Bad as Me comprises mostly love songs: paeans to lasting love, the kind that changes and bends. Even when Waits is yearning for freedom, as he does on the drunk and twitchy ""Get Lost"", he still wants his longtime girl by his side. ""When you wear that real tight sweater/ You know I can't resist/ It's been that way forever baby/ Ever since we kissed,"" he croons, his voice raw and giddy; he sounds like a guy who was pummeled by a car, got up, staggered off, and started singing. On the title track, over piano, baritone sax, and spastic guitar stabs, he celebrates mutual failure (""You're mother superior in only a bra/ You're the same kind of bad as me""), positioning compatible sin as its own triumph over circumstance.  Elsewhere, he adheres to old-fashioned ideals about the ""power of a good woman's love,"" lamenting, as he does on the ramshackle ""Raised Right Men"", the ways in which imperfect husbands (""Gunplay Maxwell and Flat Nose George, Ice Pick Ed Newcomb"") routinely fail their partners.
None of this is particularly new lyrical or musical fodder for Waits, and, nearly 20 records in, he's clearly locked into a formula-- however atypical, however idiosyncratic-- he's not particularly keen to abandon (read enough interviews, and you'll also see him trotting out the same stock punchlines-- and you'll still laugh). Still, he does push his voice here, and to wildly gratifying ends. On ""Talking at the Same Time"", a woozy, horn-accented shuffle (it evokes Ennio Morricone, David Lynch, Alice in Wonderland), he adopts a soft, wheezing falsetto, while on ""Pay Me"", he sounds docile and sleepy, like he's singing from bed (it's a heartbreaking choice for a track that contains the admission, ""They pay me not to come home"").
As with any Tom Waits album, there are a few absurd affectations at work, both on record and off (in a recent New York Times profile, Waits is caught driving a black Suburban with a newspaper announcing the inauguration of John F. Kennedy spread across the passenger seat) but there's enough variation here that all that oldness and weirdness-- all those frantic, busted melodies, all that carnie growl, all those sarsaparilla bottles banging around the backseat-- never gets tiresome. For all his indulgences, Waits never lingers too long; these tracks are concise and expertly edited, and Bad as Me feels as new as it does ancient.

Glitter and Doom Live,Tom Waits,2009,8.0,"This live record is a de facto greatest hits of Tom Waits' fourth decade of music, during which his gnarly adventurousness only intensified.
","It's hard to think of gruff Tom Waits getting his start as an earnest, albeit eccentric singer-songwriter in the 1970s. Almost immediately after releasing his debut, Closing Time, in 1973, Waits began shaking up his act and developing the oddball facets of his current persona: the hipster Beat delivery, the fascination with prowlers of back alleys and underbellies, the appreciation for jazz and blues and other American idioms, and the unmistakable voice that has grown stranger and more thunderous with each album. By the 1980s, the transformation was complete, although albums like swordfishtrombones and Rain Dogs were gambits, alienating as many fans as they attracted. In the 2000s and likely in the 2010s, few of his peers have proven so durable, so unique, so successful.
His music no longer begins and ends with an acoustic guitar and a piano, but his foundational commitment to these instruments has kept his musical excursions anchored to a songcraft that favors strict structures and bold melodies. Critically speaking, Waits-- aided and abetted by wife and musical partner, Kathleen Brennan-- is a tinkerer, assembling musical contraptions out of various styles and traditions and synthesizing blues, rock, jazz, schmaltz balladry, and even hip-hop into a truly idiosyncratic art. But I seriously doubt anyone bought tickets for his Glitter and Doom Tour last year because of his relationship to American blues. Instead, they went to see Waits the showman's showman, who regales them with tall tales of hopeless city dwellers and heartbroken hucksters with a campfire intimacy that makes these otherworldly denizens feel very real. He comes across as a scourge of the past, an affront to the modern world of blogs, bailouts, and reality TV.
His reluctance to tour regularly made Glitter and Doom one of the most coveted tickets of 2008. For those (of us) who missed it, we have Glitter and Doom Live, an album that reconstructs a typical evening with Waits (even though the tracks were recorded at different stops along the tour). While his nightly set lists generally covered every phase of his career, going back as far as ""Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis"" from 1978's Blue Valentine, this live album culls primarily from his 90s and 00s output, including several tracks rescued on 2006's Orphans. There are few nods to the 1970s and 80s, as if he's trying to avoid any overlap with his previous live album, 1988's Big Time. Glitter and Doom Live is not simply a souvenir of a tour most fans didn't attend but a de facto greatest hits of Waits' fourth decade of music, during which his gnarly adventurousness didn't wane but only intensified.
Waits leads a small but versatile band that makes these songs swing, playing up the tension without overwhelming his melodies. Omar Torrez's guitar snakes around Waits' vocals sinisterly, punctuating ""Goin' Out West"" with spiky notes. Horns flare in the crosswinds of ""Metropolitan Glide"", as if alluding to all the early 20th century artists, poets, and musicians who tried to capture the hectic rhythms of the cities with equally hectic jabs of paint, word, and noise. The percussion is crucial here, whether Waits is breathing beats into the mic or his son Casey is pounding out railroad rhythms on ""Get Behind the Mule"". Opener ""Lucinda/Ain't Goin' Down"" sounds better here than it did on Orphans, losing its beatbox backing track for a lurching ranginess that suits Waits' delivery. Likewise, ""Such a Scream"" and ""Goin' Out West"" possess a new aggression as Waits unleashes a series of dime-novel machismo boasts: ""I don't lose my composure in a high-speed chase,"" he grunts. ""My friends say I'm ugly, but I got a masculine face.""
Waits flirts with self-parody on ""Circus"" and ""I'll Shoot the Moon"", but he's been doing that for years. ""Circus"", from 2004's Real Gone, is a rambling tale of carnival characters, and ""Moon"" is a loose, loungey crooner with minimal accompaniment-- two sides of the same Waits. On the latter, he commandeers the bridge to hit on a barfly, rattling off a fake phone number: Is it unintentional schtick or simply part of the character Waits is playing in the song? He can get sentimental and even maudlin on ""Fannin Street"" and ""The Part You Throw Away"", but he's never sappy. Closer ""Lucky Day"" (like ""Moon"", from 1993's The Black Rider) ends the albums on a note that's both dreamily optimistic and earthbound by the vagaries of his voice. That's the essential contradiction of late-career Waits: He is both an incorrigible dreamer and an inveterate realist.
He's also a darn good storyteller. Right before launching into ""Lucky Day"", he holds forth on the subject of eBay, namely bidding on the dying breath of Henry Ford. It's a typical Waits yarn, drawn out with unbelievable details dug up from America's weird past, and the audience reacts with guffaws and applause. What's atypical about this story, however, is that it's the only one included on Glitter and Doom Live. The rest have been compiled on a companion disc titled ""Tom Tales"", which consists of one 35-minute track of Waits expounding on a variety of subjects (Nazi alphabet soup, uncharitable shrimp) at a variety of venues. He's funny, of course, rattling off arcane factoids and admonishing a rowdy audience to get organized with their requests. While it's better to have these stories than not, their inclusion feels like an afterthought, a tacit admission that they might have been better mixed in among the songs to give a better sense of what an evening with Waits is really like. That's only a minor complaint, as their presence here-- even excised from their original context-- nicely supplements a particularly lively live album that is also a persuasive retrospective of Waits' last 20 years.

"Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers &amp; Bastards",Tom Waits,2006,8.4,"This 3xCD box set is compartmentalized into style-segregated discs and features 30 new songs alongside a smattering of outtakes, soundtrack cuts, and other rarities.
","A musician releasing a box set is like an invitation to appraise his career, a call for preemptive obituaries and legacy judgments. But for Tom Waits, this is old news, having long ago earned the status of perennially lauded/critically invulnerable artists alongside Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen. At this point, the only thing left open to debate is, to paraphrase Stephen Colbert, Tom Waits: a great songwriter, or the greatest songwriter?
Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers & Bastards may seem like an unusual set upon which to make such a facetious judgment, given that the set is promoted as a collection of outtakes, leftovers, and rarities. But that's not quite true; for an artist like Waits, who has built his reputation on consistency and durability, it's somewhat appropriate to assess his value on the basis of his deep cuts. What's more, Orphans isn't really a career-spanning outtake collection at all, what with Tom going George Lucas on the proceedings and splicing in new songs and re-recordings. The end product, neatly compartmentalized into three style-segregated discs, is about as perfect a summary of Waits' appeal as can be found on the open market, a shadow greatest hits that offers testimony to his unique and diverse talents without recycling any of his album material.
Looking at Waits' career from a distance reveals a number of contradictions: gravel-raw hobo-rock alternating with tender jazz-crooner torch songs, one foot in blues-roots traditionalism and one ear to modern sounds (cf. the turntables and beatboxing on 2005's Real Gone), inhabiting various fictional personae or pouring out his heart like a bottle. So it makes sense to trisect his style, creating a disc for each faction of Waits' diverse audience: Brawlers for the dudes who dress and groom like Waits' stage character, Bawlers for the SUV drivers who found Waits by way of Rod Stewart, and Bastards for the people who thought the singer's high water mark was his role in Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula.
Brawlers presents probably the best-known of Tom Waits' personalities, filled as it is with vocal cord damage, found percussion, old-timey arrangements, and cartoon-buzz lead guitar. It's also the disc that flirts most dangerously with cliché, filled as it is with his well-trod inventory of Americana underbelly images: trains, jailhouses, barrooms, etc. However, the secret of Waits' act is how well he deploys these should-be-tired cultural touchstones; at the very least, he sounds more comfortable in the role of a boxcar-hopper than he does reciting the ripped-from-the-headlines Middle East folk song ""Road to Peace"". Certainly it helps that he continues to buck the aging rocker career trend of increasing cleanliness, wrapping these songs in dirt-grit production that keeps the Big Bopper warble of ""Lie to Me"" or the garage 12-bar Ramones cover ""The Return of Jackie and Judy"" from sounding like a House of Blues exhibit.
The tone of Bawlers, on the surface, is every bit as soothing as Brawlers is abrasive. But for all the gentle piano and brass embellishments, the mood is far from serene, inhabiting the bittersweet, sentimental borderline between a bender and hangover. Given that this sound goes back to Waits' earliest days, the timeframe is wider here than elsewhere in the set, yet it holds together with a late-night woozy consistency while veering from AM-radio jazz (""You Can Never Hold Back Spring"") to folk (""Widow's Grove""), and intimate (""World Keeps Turning"") to show-stoppingly anthemic (""Never Let Go"", ""Down There By the Train""). More than any other disc, Bawlers is proof that Waits can pull these kind of nightclub-act songs out of his derby hat at will, able to channel the archetypal piano-man character with minimal effort.
All the more impressive then that he's made the effort to sabotage that typecasting, as exemplified by the set's most fascinating disc, Bastards. Collecting all the odd items that don't fall into a simple quiet-loud dichotomy, Bastards reveals Waits at his most theatrical, filled with weird spoken-word monologues, gypsy-opera arrangements, a capella experiments, and demented covers. Few people can make music that's authentically frightening without crossing the line into campy silliness, yet this is another skill Waits can lay claim to; look no further than the Disney nightmare of his ""Heigh Ho"" or the ghoulish nature documentary of ""Army Ants"". There may be nothing else on these three discs as striking as ""Dog Door"", his collaboration with Sparklehorse that traps Waits' repertoire of voices in a funhouse of synths and tape loops, a thrilling (and teasingly rare) modern take on his familiar formula.
But you can't really fault Waits for only dipping an occasional toe into modern sounds, as his career has been built on being a living repository of 20th century American music and culture, while turning the neat trick of engaging that history rather than curating it. Orphans, most notably, is smoking-gun evidence of Waits' remarkable longevity, as it's hard to think of many other artists that could place new material adjacent to old without the result sounding disjointed or wildly disparate in quality. It's enough to add another layer of invulnerability to the already untouchable critical status of Tom Waits, an unlikely benefit coming from a cleaning-house box set.

Real Gone,Tom Waits,2004,8.0,"18th proper studio album from the gruff-voiced singer/songwriter serves marks a departure from 2002's Alice and Blood Money, with an emphasis on mouth-made percussion. Avant-garde guitarist Marc Ribot guests for the first time since 1999's Mule Variations, while other notable contributors include Primus' Les Claypool and Brain Manita, and Waits' son Casey.
","Tom Waits sings with his eyes closed, face squished tight, arms jerking, elbows popping, his entire body curled small and fetal around the microphone stand. Waits' mouth is barely open, but his ears are perked high, perfectly straight, craning skyward, stretching out: Tom Waits is channeling frequencies that the rest of us cannot hear.
In a 2002 interview with GQ's Elizabeth Gilbert, Tom Waits talked forgivingly about his ears, mumbling humbly about an innate, almost inhuman sensitivity to sound. For Waits, the amplification of everyday chatter has long functioned as both a service and a liability, feeding his music and completely screwing up his life. Real Gone, like most of Tom Waits' records, is teeming with all kinds of mysterious noises: clangs and spits, faceless hollers, squawks, irrational toots, not-quite-human coughs, vicious bangs, apologetic whispers. It lurches along like a junk-heap jalopy, unsteady and unsafe, bits flying off in every direction, stopping, starting, and bouncing in pain.
It hasn't always been this way. Sometime in the early 1980s, Waits stumbled past a mirror, caught a quick glimpse of his knobby mug, and was slapped with a cosmic, knee-wobbling epiphany: Tom Waits saw Billy Joel. Waits' subsequent work-- especially the raucous, circus-heavy Rain Dogs, or the glorious Swordfishtrombones-- established him as a blue-ribbon eccentric, cranking out perfect anti-ballads as an antidote to Piano Man temptations. Wife and longtime collaborator Kathleen Brennan (who co-wrote and co-produced Real Gone, along with Waits' last eleven records), has sagely proclaimed that all Tom Waits' songs can be easily slapped into one of two categories: Grim Reapers and Grand Weepers. Happily, Real Gone has its share of both-- although devious preference is, of course, purposefully paid to the former.
For Real Gone, Waits ditched his trademark piano and most of his rhythm section, opting instead to cough up man-made beats like hairballs and sputter abrasive scats. Waits relishes his vocal tics and impossibly gnarled pipes, shamelessly savoring his homemade racket, building more and more momentum with each new bark. Unsurprisingly, Waits' sputters can get a bit tiring (they're certainly repetitive), but they ultimately lend his work a weird, organic immediacy, freezing it forever in time-- he could never make this record again, or at least not in the exact same way. His bursts are too spontaneous, too imperfect-- which makes Real Gone more about Tom Waits than anything or anyone else. Appropriately, Waits' fingerprints are everywhere; his blood drips from every twist and cackle, his spit soars and splatters. After a few spins of Real Gone, you almost want to wipe your face off.
Lyrically, Waits still excels, beating out his peers in both absurdity and grace. Nobody howls warnings quite like Tom Waits, and the deliciously apocalyptic ""Don't Go into That Barn"" features some of his best poetic barbs, cawed as a challenge, confrontational and wicked. Waits is a storyteller in the best campfire tradition, and his cautionary fables are never without the proper exposition (""Bank since Saginaw Calinda was born/ It's been cotton, soybeans, tobacco and corn/ Behind the porticoed house/ Of a long dead farm/ They found the falling down timbers of a spooky old barn""). Waits is preoccupied with specifics, never once mewing a vague scenario or untied emotion. His songs may be tremendously bizarre, even ominous-- but they're always exceptionally real; every character has a pair of trousers to wear, a meal to chew, a task to complete. And there is always a place that Tom Waits thinks it would be best for them to avoid.
Real Gone does stumble a bit, with Waits occasionally overindulging his quirks. ""Circus"", a tedious spoken word manifesto layered over muted, lazy horn wails, feels uncommonly stagnant; ""Sins of My Father"", which clocks in at 11 minutes, is unforgivably long. And opener ""Top of the Hill"" remains, somehow, both the best and worst thing you'll hear all year: Waits' grimaced beats, tangled up in themselves, shudder alongside a simple electric guitar melody and a repeated, shrugging request (""Come and get me on the ride up/ I'm only goin' to the top of the hill""). The song heaves on even when you think it should stop, growing increasingly breathless by the second, as if Waits really was lumbering uphill, begging you for a lift. And when you finally stop wincing, when you finally pull over and open the door-- you grin and you dance.

Used Songs: 1973-1980,Tom Waits,2001,8.8,"So, here's the question: how do you go from James Taylor comparisons to being mentioned in the same breath ...
","So, here's the question: how do you go from James Taylor comparisons to being mentioned in the same breath as weirdos Harry Partch, Captain Beefheart and William S. Burroughs? And the answer is: I don't know. Ask Tom Waits. He'd probably tip his hat back, mumble some lengthy convoluted story about how he was born in the back of a cab, and go straight into how he was hired for his first paying gig based solely on the shoes he was wearing. After which, he'll most likely break into a wide, toothy grin, scoop up some confetti from his coat pocket and sprinkle it over his head before he vanishes in a cloud of sawdust and smoke.
Back before his days as demented carnival barker and the macabre stories of butchers, German dwarves and the Eyeball Kid, Tom Waits was plying his craft as a gravel voiced faux-beat singer plink-plonking his way around a piano and writing songs about hookers, hobos and gangsters. Come to think of it, Waits has been dancing around the same ideas, updating variations on the same characters in his own twisted, offbeat mythologies since the mid-70s. It's just that when 1983 and Swordfishtrombones rolled around the songs transformed into something much more carnival-esque, while the music drifted into the sphere of Partch-like percussion and disjointed guitar riffs.
Up to that point, he'd (for the most part) been working with mainly conventional melodies and dipping his fingers into folk, rock and jazz. During that early time, he had a musical persona that was street-smart swagger mixed with affection for all the losers and down-and-outs. Throughout three decades of writing songs, he's always been in touch with society's seedy underbelly, reserving a place in his songs for the downtrodden and the beat. Whether you belong to an underground civilization of dwarves or you're a down-on-his-luck bum sitting in a puddle of rain, you've got a place in Waits' world.
What with the drastic musical makeover and label jump in the 80s, a distinctive line was drawn between the later work and the 70s stuff. Ask pretty much any longtime Waits fan what their favorite album is and they might just give you two: one from his early drunken-lounge-singer years and one from his post-1983-metamorphosis into ghoulish Vaudevillian ringleader. All this shifting and change makes it frustratingly impossible to put together a career-spanning single disc retrospective, so what Rhino and Mr. Waits have put together instead is a hodgepodge of tracks from the Elektra/Asylum years.
Enough with the introduction, then. Let's get to the meat of the matter. What's the track selection like? Are there rarities? Outtakes and demos? Live obscurities? Well, as the title suggests, Used Songs is an assortment of 16 tracks spanning from Waits' first album, Closing Time, to 1980's Heartattack and Vine. Everything that's to be had here is available on the official releases from the period and much of it's been collected previously on two separate anthologies. So everyone out there holding their breath for unreleased tracks and live-only gems like ""Hokey Pokey"" and ""Trash Day"" can keep their fingers crossed for next time.
What's obvious on first glance at the song selection is the lack of very early material. Only three tracks from the first three albums appear, while the later albums often get three or four tracks apiece. ""Ol' 55,"" made famous by the Eagles, is the only track on here from Closing Time and it's drastically different than anything else, even though it might be the most recognizable to the Waits novice. It captures Waits in his early years, his voice still smooth, and the comparisons to James Taylor and the singer/songwriters of the period still apt.
By the time he'd recorded the rambling small-town beauty of ""(Looking for) The Heart of Saturday Night"" Waits' voice was already exhibiting signs of the gravel voice that would become so signature to his later sound. The only live track available here is from Nighthawks at the Diner, the in-studio recording documenting Waits' inclination to rambling offbeat stories, which eventually segue into tracks like ""Eggs and Sausage (In a Cadillac with Susan Michelson).""
And then, somewhere around 1976, Waits found a new distinctive voice that blended the sprawling myths of American culture and city life with the poetry and swagger of beats like Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady. If you add to the mix his ability to turn a line, an offbeat sense of humor and an increasing musical vocabulary, the result was something completely enchanting. Tracks like the Elvis-inspired strut of ""Burma Shave"" or the heartbreaking pair ""Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis"" and ""Blue Valentines"" are windows into American life akin to the heartbreak, desolation and simple warmth of an Edward Hopper painting. In the jazz-poetry goof on the sleazy-salesman's ""Step Right Up,"" Waits spits out a sequence of hilarious one-liners: ""It gives you an erection/ It wins the election"" or ""Change your shorts/ Change your life/ Change your life/ Change into a nine-year old Hindu boy/ Get rid of your wife.""
An odd inclusion here is the duet with Bette Midler, ""I Never Talk to Strangers,"" from 1977's Foreign Affairs. The track itself is a pretty standard jazz duet, with banter between the two singers exchanged throughout. Even though they're not included here, Waits went on to offer much more successful duets on record, with Crystal Gayle (an even odder choice?) on the soundtrack to One from the Heart. By the time Waits recorded his last album for Asylum in 1980 (Heartattack and Vine), rock was his primary musical influence and he'd almost abandoned the neo-beat persona completely. Bruce Springsteen would later take the sha-la-la's and tenderness of ""Jersey Girl"" and turn them into a hit. Notice the trend in artists turning Waits-penned tunes into hits.
""Tom Traubert's Blues (Four Sheets to the Wind in Copenhagen)"" closes the disc. Taken from 1976's Small Change, it's the perfect closer to the album and, in my opinion, the best track available here. A downtrodden tale full of woe and misfortune, it's one of those tracks that puts you right on the barstool, fifth beer in front of you-- a portrait of loneliness and bleakness. It's a harrowing romance from probably the greatest album of Waits' early years, which brings me to my problem with the collection.
Small Change is sadly under-represented here, with only the amazing ""Step Right Up"" and ""Tom Traubert's Blues"" on the roll call. So, my only complaint about this record is the questionable absence of the gorgeous ""Invitation to the Blues."" Other than that and some near-clunkers (""I Never Talk to Strangers""), Used Songs is an exceptional gathering of Waits' material.
But I guess the question remains: is the compilation worth the investment? Well, for Waits beginners, this and the recently compiled Beautiful Maladies are perfect launching points into both eras of his career. Sadly, these are only temporary fixes. It'll just make most people clamber for albums like Small Change and Blue Valentines or Rain Dogs and Bone Machine. But, for me and fellow collector scum, sets like this serve as additions to a completists' collection. Finally, though, these two anthologies make it painfully obvious that if anyone at all deserves the box set treatment (outtakes, demos, live cuts and unreleased nuggets like ""Alice""), Mr. Waits is easily the number one contender.

Mule Variations,Tom Waits,1999,9.5,"I once took a poetry workshop taught by a guy called Ed Dorn. You may have heard of Ed Dorn ...
","I once took a poetry workshop taught by a guy called Ed Dorn. You may have heard of Ed Dorn. He's a fairly famous guy, as poets go, and he's written his fair share of well- known poems. The first day of Dorn's poetry workshop consisted of him delivering a sometimes scathing and mostly nonsensical monologue that veered from Roman aqueducts to the Russian poet Akhmatova to indigenous North African peoples. The main thrust was one simple point: nobody has written a truly great poem over the course of the last fifty years, and if anyone is going to write the one great poem of the last quarter of the twentieth century, it was not going to be one of us sophomore- year poetry scrubs. Sorry, it just wasn't.
I'd like to take this opportunity to extend Ed Dorn's admonition to the bulk of Pitchfork's readership, and to amend it thusly: neither will any of you write a song as good as Tom Waits' very worst song. Sorry, you just won't. And to reach the levels of one of his very best songs, you'd have to spend the next twenty years training with ninjas in a high mountain monastery, travel from there to Haiti to have bizarre Voudun rites performed over your writing hand, and then sell your soul to Satan for good measure. Better get started.
So far, reviews of Mule Variations have been mixed, ranging from shameless hero worship (yeah, yeah, like this one), to jaded critics claiming that Waits hit his songwriting peak with 1985's Rain Dogs. Some guy recently told a friend of mine that he didn't like Mule Variations because ""I saw Waits play in San Francisco in the late '80s, and I just wasn't that into it, cuz I liked Waits better when he was a ballad singer."" What does that mean? I have one theory about those dissing Mule Variations: they know in their hearts what Ed Dorn and I have just told you, and crying out ""He's slipping!"" is a backhanded way of claiming equality with one of the world's greatest living performers.
Don't listen to the bastards and their sour grapes. Mule Variations is a great album, and that's all there is to it. Sonically, it picks up where Bone Machine left off , but drops some of that album's artifice: the clattering, trebly out- back- of- the- shed sound is still here and the inexplicable presence of Primus persists, but many of these songs find Waits relaxing his krazy karnival barker persona. The songs most people are keying on-- ""Big in Japan,"" ""Filipino Box Spring Hog"" and ""Eyeball Kid"" have been getting a lot of airtime lately on my local college station-- are standard later- era Waits jams, complete with weird rattling percussion and menacing images of hellhounds and mutant children.
But the really good stuff here, as with any Tom Waits record, is the slower stuff. ""Hold On"" has a classic ""Jersey Girl"" vibe, and while there may be a little lyrical cheez involved, it's exciting to hear a return to that sound. ""Pony,"" ""House Where Nobody Lives"" and ""Picture In a Frame"" are ballads that can stand with Waits' best, from earlier tunes like ""Burma Shave"" or ""Martha"" straight through to ""A Little Rain."" The album- closing bittersweet mid- tempo rocker tradition has never seen a better entry than ""Come On Up to the House,"" and the strange, out- of- phase falsetto backing vocals on ""Black Market Baby"" are alone worth the price of admission.
It's true that this is not Rain Dogs, Swordfishtrombones or even Frank's Wild Years. But is it Tom Waits' fault that people are so hung up on those particular albums? Look, you've got two options here: you can continue to bolster your own nonexistent street cred by dissing new Tom Waits in favor of old Tom Waits, or you can give it up, admit that it's all great and increase your own personal enjoyment. The choice seems like a no- brainer to me.

An American Treasure,Tom Petty,2018,8.3,"This big box set marks the first posthumous release from the Petty estate and finds new meaning both through songs we thought we knew and necessary obscurities.
","Tom Petty’s music has been obsessively compiled, assessed, and summarized. If you want the full story, there’s Peter Bogdanovich’s four-hour documentary, Runnin’ Down a Dream. If you’re interested in a grittier account, try Warren Zanes’ epic biography, Petty. Here for the music? In 1995, Petty mined his vaults with Playback, a comprehensive collection filled with singles, deep cuts, and outtakes. That set arrived just two years after his 12-times platinum Greatest Hits, expanded in 2000 for the immersive Anthology: Through the Years. And befitting a bandleader who many would argue lit up the stage more naturally than the studio, there’s 2009’s four-disc Live Anthology, collecting highlights from three decades on the road.
Petty’s legacy has been sustained through such retrospectives, arguably more than any other artist of the classic rock era. His output was so consistent for so long that no single studio record could accurately frame the breadth and depth of his catalog. Following his death last fall, it was both telling and touching to hear famous fans covering songs from across his career, whether it was the National dusting off a late-career weeper, Phoebe Bridgers meditating on a 1987 deep cut, Bob Dylan putting his spin on a singalong strummer, or Miley Cyrus closing her eyes and belting out a wistful lullaby. While compilations can feel like cash grabs or contractual obligations, Petty’s music invites this type of listening. His songs form their own universe, primed for diving in and finding your own little corner.
So An American Treasure—a new career-spanning collection and the first posthumous release from the Petty estate—is not without precedent, making its ability to say something new even more impressive. No Tom Petty collection has ever felt so thoughtful or complete. With a tracklist selected by those closest to him—his wife, Dana; daughter, Adria; two Heartbreakers bandmates, Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench; and his studio collaborator Ryan Ulyate—it’s the rare career survey that makes you reconsider the work it collects. It is filled with love, vulnerable in a way it might not have been had Petty himself overseen it.
Consider the inclusion of an alternate version of “Rebels,” a song with a troubled history. In the mid-1980s, Petty and his Heartbreakers toiled over the Southern Accents opener, culminating in Petty breaking his left hand after punching a wall in frustration. He felt that the studio rendition didn’t hold up to his original demo, and the Heartbreakers were losing valuable studio time worrying with it. Listening again, the problem seems obvious: Like a lot of Petty standards, “Rebels” is both anthem and elegy—the tale of a down-and-out Southerner confronting his limitations, dwelling in pain that was once pride. With a triumphant horn section and a “hey hey hey” refrain, the music works directly against the lyrics. On any given listen, you might hear one side winning over the other. It’s a fascinating battle for a listener but a frustrating one for an author trying to document a definitive take. With a slightly altered mix and more dynamic horns, this version feels more decisive.
The context helps, too. Petty’s growth as a songwriter is the focus of An American Treasure, which shades in the spaces between his radio staples and leaves room for his growing pains and left turns. There’s no “Free Fallin’” or “American Girl,” but four selections from 2002’s oft-derided The Last DJ make the cut. That album’s poor reputation is based in part on its bitter reflections on a changing music industry, but these highlights focus on the wild romance that brought Petty to the business in the first place. The gorgeous “Like a Diamond,” the swooning road song “You and Me,” and the sprawling “Have Love Will Travel” are all solid additions to his catalog of love songs. They shine brighter here, their happy endings left in place.
For the most part, Petty albums are focused and concise, sometimes to a fault. His compilations make room for all the detours he could have taken. As usual, the selected outtakes are as polished and enduring as the album cuts. “I Don’t Belong,” recorded for 1999’s dark Echo, merges post-grunge angst with power-pop sweetness. It presages Americana-based indie by the likes of Rilo Kiley and Bright Eyes that would help carry Petty’s influence into the next decade. More famous outtakes like “Keeping Me Alive” and “Surrender” (which previously appeared on Playback and Anthology, respectively) now seem as immortal as any of his hits, despite never making it onto a proper album.
Many of Petty’s best-loved songs find new resonance here. Stripped-back takes of “I Won’t Back Down,” “Insider,” and “Even the Losers” unveil the multiple perspectives locked within Petty’s most familiar tunes. He was not an autobiographical songwriter, but his character-based writing, so free of pretense, feels revealing. “Two Gunslingers,” an allegory that offers as much wisdom about senseless violence as it does a toxic relationship or a bad record deal, appears in a live acoustic rendition that is more baldly emotional than its studio counterpart. It is a showcase for the tenderness that allowed him to find success even as he mellowed out. “You’re a good man to ride the river with,” Johnny Cash once wrote to Petty, aptly capturing the comforting presence that shined through all his greatest songs. Working mostly chronologically, this set flows so that you feel you’re riding alongside him.
Both the condensed and deluxe editions of An American Treasure stretch from Petty’s early tracks with the Heartbreakers to his late work with Mudcrutch, the hometown band he reunited in 2007 and with whom he’d release his final music. “This town broke my heart/Then just carried on like nothing happened at all,” he sings in the closer, “Hungry No More.” It’s easy to imagine this being the fear that drove so much of his music: our stories and memories forgotten, leaving the world with us. There’s a distinct desire in Petty’s work to make an immortal connection, whether that means getting back in touch with his old Gainesville pals or writing hits that would echo in stadiums around the world. An American Treasure doesn’t prioritize one more than the other, because Petty never saw a distinction.

Damn the Torpedoes,Tom Petty,1979,9.2,"Damn the Torpedos is the peak of Tom Petty’s songwriting with the Heartbreakers. Slick, big, and immutably classic, the album is a front-to-back feat of production and songwriting.
","Before he was the American bard of the wandering, willful, and stoned, Tom Petty was an ornery Southerner who migrated from a Florida college town to scrape together a record deal in the rotten heart of the Southern California record business. Four years after signing with Shelter Records, and in the midst of recording the third Heartbreakers album for the label, it all went bad.
When MCA bought Shelter’s fledgling parent company ABC in 1979, Petty tried to opt out of his contract—in which he’d naively ceded all publishing royalties—and MCA and Shelter sued him in L.A. Superior Court. Refusing to be “bought and sold like a piece of meat,” Petty threatened to shelve his band’s new album, and MCA counter-threatened to confiscate the band’s session tapes—legally, their property. Petty then privately told a studio assistant to hide each day’s reels in a secret location without his knowledge. Petty’s final blow was filing for bankruptcy, which opened his current contracts to renegotiation and signaled that he wasn’t about to flinch. Remarkably, MCA and Shelter caved. MCA kept Petty on contract, but it was now far more lucrative with significant creative latitude. They also returned to him all publishing rights and gave him his own boutique label, Backstreet. It was a rare victory in a cutthroat business: a musician called a major label’s bluff and forced them to fold. The album the Heartbreakers released that October, a day before Petty’s 29th birthday and four months after his Chapter 11 filing, was appropriately titled Damn the Torpedoes.
”We didn’t sit around and talk about making an album about that experience,” Petty told Rolling Stone in 1980, “but we knew we were. They get you pinned in a corner, and the last thing you can do to keep your sanity is write songs.” Especially for someone who specialized in songs about losers trying to get by, Torpedoes was a positively triumphant moment. Thanks in large part to the studio wizardry of producer Jimmy Iovine and engineer Shelly Yakus, “Refugee,” “Don’t Do Me Like That,” and “Here Comes My Girl” sounded massive on FM radio. After two studio albums, after “Breakdown” barely cracked the Top 40 and “American Girl” didn’t even chart, after four years in the industry mines and a few months of court battles, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers had finally conquered the pop world.
Torpedoes sat at No. 2 on the Billboard albums chart for seven weeks—kept from the top spot by Pink Floyd’s The Wall—and would eventually sell nearly three million copies. The band’s stardom was actually validated through MCA’s own blinkered corporate logic. Having learned no lessons from testing Petty’s will, the label determined that the Heartbreakers now qualified for its unscrupulous “Superstar Pricing,” an increase from $8.98 to $9.98 already applied to big sellers like Steely Dan’s Gaucho and the Xanadu soundtrack from ELO and Olivia Newton-John. Yet again, Petty threatened to withhold the LP—arguing that his label was trying to price-gouge his fans—or title it Eight Ninety-Eight. MCA decided it wasn’t worth the trouble. Petty won again, and named the followup Hard Promises.
The Heartbreakers—guitarist Mike Campbell, keyboardist Benmont Tench, drummer Stan Lynch, and bassist Ron Blair—split the difference between a lot of styles: They weren’t massive UK art-rock or the arena-sized metal of AC/DC and Van Halen. They were an L.A. band, but without the slick, expensive sound of Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles. They fit somewhere between spiky new wave, the blue-collar rock of Bob Seger and Bruce Springsteen, and the emergent crop of critically-beloved, acerbic UK traditionalists Elvis Costello, Nick Lowe, Graham Parker, and Joe Jackson. In the previous few years, the Heartbreakers had opened for everyone from Blondie to Bob Seger, the Kinks, Al Kooper, Rush, even the jazz-rock ensemble Tom Scott and the L.A. Express—but had never headlined their own tour. Their second album You’re Gonna Get It! had gone gold, but Petty was tired of being a support act. He wanted the third album to be different, and definitely bigger.
Enter Jimmy Iovine.
Four years earlier at 21, he’d stumbled into engineering Born to Run and studied  Bruce Springsteen’s studio perfectionism during some long sessions at New York City’s Record Plant. Springsteen’s insistence on perfecting Max Weinberg’s drum sound on the album—three weeks’ worth of insistent tracking and re-tracking—even forced Iovine to quit on one occasion. A few years later, Iovine signed on to produce Patti Smith’s third album Easter while he was engineering Springsteen’s Darkness on the Edge of Town. Knowing that Smith’s long-delayed third LP had no lead single, he coaxed Springsteen into giving Smith a skeletal tune he’d shelved—just a chorus, really—called “Because the Night.” Smith finished the song, and her scenery-chewing romantic mini-opera was easily her biggest hit. It sounded great, too, thanks in large part to veteran engineer Shelly Yakus, whom Iovine loved. The Heartbreakers loved “Because the Night”—I mean, everyone loved it—and Lynch was particularly fond of Yakus’ drum sound on the record. Shelter brokered an introduction between Petty and Iovine, and when Petty played him the demos of “Refugee” and “Here Comes My Girl,” Iovine was instantly sold. “It’s the first and last time I’ve ever said to anyone that they don’t need any more songs,” Iovine later recalled. “I’ve never said that to anyone since.” According to Petty, after he played the songs, Iovine looked around the room and exclaimed: “We’re all going to be millionaires!” Iovine signed on to produce Torpedoes and showed up in Van Nuys’ Sound City studio with Yakus as his engineer.
The first single released from Torpedoes, the roller-rink R&B of “Don’t Do Me Like That,” was the band’s highest-charting yet, reaching the Billboard top 10 and saturating rock radio playlists through 1980. The song dated back to demos from Petty’s first band, Mudcrutch, and packed significantly more Gainesville choogle than anything else on Torpedoes, or either of the first two records, for that matter. Petty was planning on giving it to the J. Geils Band, which made perfect sense—their 1981 hit “Centerfold” would borrow its bounce—until Iovine insisted that the Heartbreakers re-record it. It’s a unique single in the band’s discography, as close to the proto-MTV new wave as the Heartbreakers would get. Tench’s piano plinks and tangy organ licks play tag with Campbell’s chicken-scratch riffs and Lynch’s tumbling fills, while Petty spits admonitions in a sprechgesang that owed as much to Stax R&B lifer Rufus Thomas as any contemporaneous rock frontman.
The Heartbreakers were more used to gigging as a group than playing separate studio parts, and Iovine and Yakus put the quinet through its paces during the tumultuous Torpedoes sessions, which Petty was regularly leaving to meet with MCA’s lawyers a half-hour south on the 405 in Century City. Iovine’s meticulous studio M.O. chafed against the Heartbreakers’ lackadaisical approach. “We would sit back and get stoned and discuss it for a while, and then jam for a while,” Campbell remembered. After several days of Iovine’s and Yakus’ obsession over the album’s drum sound, particularly during the recording of “Refugee,” which, according to the band, took between 100 and 200 takes, Lynch and Campbell reached their breaking points. Iovine nagged Lynch to break free from his style of playing to the point that he actually quit the band (and was coaxed back by Petty). Pushed to the edge by the constant bickering, Campbell disappeared for a bit as well. Yakus’ preoccupation with Lynch’s drum sound led him to tune his heads much looser, resulting in a muffled tone similar to what he achieved on Easter. It might have driven Lynch nuts, but it sounded great on record and radio. Entire music recording messageboard threads are devoted to trying to match the gear, mic positions, and tunings that Yakus perfected on Torpedoes.
Released in January 1980 as Torpedoes’ second single, “Refugee” was the best-recorded and hardest-sounding song the Heartbreakers had yet released. For an album recorded in L.A., “Refugee” sounds incredibly New York—more alleyway than highway, which the band recognized in the song’s music video. It was certainly anthemic, but in place of “Because the Night”’s Orbisonian romanticism was a searing, metallic sound, no less menacing for its exquisite mix; a blend of Tench’s keyboard stabs with Campbell’s blues-derived minor riff (which he’d taught himself from listening to late-’60s John Mayall albums). Petty did not boast Smith’s or Springsteen’s poetic inclinations but offered a variation on a spoken/sung verse. The shift from his laconic, stonerish Southern drawl on the verses to the in-the-red adenoidal yawp on the chorus is still thrilling, and peaks at the last word of the middle-eight, when he shreds his vocal cords before Campbell’s solo: “One of those things you gotta feel to be truuuuuue!”
Like most rock lyrics, “Refugee” is best read as a composite of ideas and characters. It’s certainly, at some level, Petty’s translation of his unsettled state as the creative ward of a corporation during the song’s composition. Yet he maps this frustration onto his favorite theme: a wayward soul looking for a home. A couple years after the titular character of “American Girl” sought “a little more to life, somewhere else,” here was another girl, or maybe the same one, rootless and worse for wear. Indeed, the clearest predecessor to “Refugee” from a narrative standpoint isn’t “Because the Night” or anything from Born to Run or Darkness on the Edge of Town, but Steely Dan’s gloomily empathetic 1974 ode to a troubled transient making her way through L.A.’s Chandleresque underbelly, “Rikki Don’t Lose That Number.”
If “Refugee” was the perfect outcome of the Heartbreakers-Iovine mind-meld, then “Here Comes My Girl” added some twists to the band’s jangle-pop arsenal. Ever the traditionalist, Petty was a fan of ’50s throwback and CBGBs mainstay Mink DeVille, and on the verses of “Girl,” he tweaks the speak-sing into the dejected persona of a hard-luck nobody, a worn-down iteration of DeVille’s streetcorner hustler archetype. Petty’s voice morphs into a rasp on the pre-chorus, before coming to full bloom on the chorus, when the streetwise greaser lapses into a romantic stupor at the mere sight of his beloved. Petty’s dead-on imitation of Roger McGuinn’s gentle tenor is backed by Tench drizzling piano notes on one edge of the song and holding a sustained, dreamlike organ chord on another. Petty’s career is defined by his mastery of effortlessly pretty medium-tempo grooves, and the “Girl” chorus stands out among them: It’s both the most genuinely sweet and unexpectedly psychedelic moment in Petty’s extensive canon of hooks.
Speaking of choruses, is there a single six-word phrase more humbly aligned with rock’s zero-to-hero mythos than, “Even the losers get lucky sometimes”? Not released as a single but later included on the band’s over-10-million-selling Greatest Hits package, “Even the Losers” shows Petty in his American Elvis Costello mode, equal parts snarl and self-deprecation, and features a killer Chuck Berry-derived solo from Campbell, who’d come into his own as a sideman while Petty developed his songwriting chops. His fiery solos on Eddie Cochran-style deep-cut rave-ups “Century City” (Petty’s snide take on the corporate L.A. enclave where he battled his label) and “What Are You Doin’ in My Life?” showed his old school chops, while his slide work on album-closing ballad “Louisiana Rain” displayed his capacity to channel Beggars Banquet-era Keith Richards.
Torpedoes’ hits can overshadow the fact that the album—far from the singles-and-filler approach of so many contemporaries and predecessors—is end-to-end great. Beatles acolytes that they were, Petty and Campbell urged Iovine to keep random bits of studio noise in the tracklisting, including a trippy drum loop that segued into Campbell’s wife yelling, “It’s just the normal noises in here!” which Petty grabbed from the four-track demos Campbell cut in his living room. Torpedoes-era Heartbreakers deserve to be in the conversation with the critically-adored post-Beatles studio-rats generally referred to as “power pop”: Todd Rundgren, the Raspberries, Badfinger, Dwight Twilley, the Flamin’ Groovies, and Cheap Trick. Consider the breadth and confidence of the band who gave the world the album track “You Tell Me,” which opens as slick, urbane L.A. pop (which Sheryl Crow would later unconsciously plagiarize for “My Favorite Mistake”) before segueing into the kind of nerdy, nasal hook-fest that lesser-known power-pop contemporaries like Shoes and 20/20 would’ve killed for. Or the nod to the Drifters’ “There Goes My Baby” that opens “Shadow of a Doubt,” a breezy Americana romp that, with hindsight, predicts peak Wilco by a couple decades.
Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers made music that still befuddles critics: they were too chill to be punk, and too famous to be underdogs. Petty was too unassuming a superstar to be Springsteen, and though he was equally gnomic and cantankerous, he was far too lyrically judicious to be Dylan. They were a singles band who made great albums and a “heartland” band from L.A. via Gainesville. In the year that Graham Parker’s Squeezing Out Sparks took top honors in the Pazz & Jop critics’ poll, Torpedoes finished eighth, which the Village Voice’s Robert Christgau chalked up to votes from conservative daily paper rock critics, and though he was happy Petty beat Supertramp and the Eagles, he snorted, “If Tom Petty ends up defining rock and roll heaven, then Johnny Rotten will have died in vain.” Of course, Petty himself knew more than anyone that the very idea of a “rock and roll heaven” is ridiculous. There are players and songs, producers and albums, labels and gigs, fans and critics, and his job was not to aim toward redemption or salvation, but to keep a little bit of pride, get lucky sometimes, and always move forward, full speed ahead.

Full Moon Fever,Tom Petty,1989,8.1,"On his debut solo album, Tom Petty’s economical, thoughtful songwriting gelled with Jeff Lynne’s restrained production. They crafted a laid-back sound but kept the tension of heartland rock‘n’roll.
","Part of the reason Tom Petty’s passing earlier this month felt so profound was his unofficial status as the mortar of classic-rock radio. The Florida-born, Malibu-haunting music lifer had top billing on a slew of songs that served as the glue between your Stones and Beatles chestnuts—the spitfire chronicle of lovers’ wariness “Refugee,” the sparkle of “The Waiting.” The format’s parameters had already been well-established by the time Full Moon Fever—the first album credited to Petty without his longtime musical pals the Heartbreakers—came out in the spring of 1989. But as soon as its first single, the laid-back yet steadfast “I Won’t Back Down,” was released, the rule book was rewritten.
Full Moon Fever came out of a most Southern Californian set of circumstances. In November 1987, Petty—then coming off his seventh album as frontman of the Heartbreakers, Let Me Up (I’ve Had Enough), as well as a May 1987 arson attack on his house—had a chance encounter with Jeff Lynne, the songwriter and maximalist producer behind Electric Light Orchestra, at a traffic light (“just before the Thrifty [Drug Store],” he told SPIN in 1989) that, as it happened, was located near where they lived. Lynne was just off producing George Harrison’s Cloud Nine, the 1987 album that spawned the surprise MTV hit “Got My Mind Set on You,” and was at work on Brian Wilson’s “Let It Shine.” ”Around Christmas that year, I wrote a couple of songs and showed them to [Lynne], and he had a few suggestions, which really improved them,” Petty told The Chicago Tribune in 1989. “So we ended up going over to [Heartbreakers guitarist] Mike Campbell’s house and putting them down in his studio… by then I was already having too much fun and I didn’t want to stop and go back to doing nothing, so I kept convincing Jeff song by song to do one more, and then finally hooked him into finishing the whole album.”
Even at its most urgent, Full Moon Fever has a laid-back feel. Petty’s sardonic observations, delivered in his wizened drawl, coast on loose-limbed riffs that were largely written with the rhythm guitar parts at the forefront of Petty and Lynne’s collective mind. Every song was written on 12-string or 6-string acoustic guitars. Petty told The Boston Globe in 1989: “I wanted to experiment with the art of rhythm guitar. Jeff and I feel that acoustic guitars can be rock’n’roll instruments, not just folk instruments.”
The sun-soaked chords that open the sprawl-dwelling and regretful “Free Fallin’” set the album’s tone. They tug the action along while Petty, half-sly and half-wistful, recounts the wounds suffered by a young woman who was focused on Elvis and horses before the allure of the bad boy creeps into her life. On the chorus, his voice cracks into a “free!” that sounds liberated, but it almost immediately skids into a descending “fa-lli-ing” that reveals the more alarming aspects of being unmoored, an uneasiness that persists even as the churning bridge rises up. The rest of Full Moon Fever balances that tension beautifully. Lynne’s restrained production and Petty’s economical, thoughtful songwriting combine into a sneakily powerful collection of songs.
Full Moon Fever is billed as Petty’s “first solo record,” although it’s not a clean break from the Heartbreakers—keyboardist Benmont Tench and bassist Howie Epstein have brief cameos, Campbell has a co-writing credit on the new wave-tinged “Love Is a Long Road” and laid down the insistent riff that propels “Runnin’ Down a Dream.” That song’s journey toward being history’s most chilled-out jock jam rides on Campbell’s blistering skill, both on the song’s signature riff and on the pyrotechnic playing that closes it out. Petty’s meditative, rueful vocal acts as a knowing counterpoint, its descriptions of frantically driving around in search of “somethin’ good waitin’ down this road” winds around Campbell’s forward momentum.
The lyrics are often minimalist, packing a punch with the subtle detailing that made Petty’s earlier work appealing to arena-sized crowds. “Yer So Bad” opens with an of-its-moment observation about a woman whose romantic trajectory veers, unfortunately, from a money-laden yuppie to a swinging singer, with Petty unable to “decide which is worse.” “A Face in the Crowd” is all atmospherics, Petty’s murmured refrain and the crystal-gilded guitars giving a rainy-day feel to its full-hearted, yet sparsely told tale of having someone parachute “out of a dream, out of the sky” and into his life.
Petty’s love of rock—specifically, his belief in its power to unite—permeates his catalog, but on Full Moon Fever it especially shines. There are references to Elvis and Del Shannon dotting the lyrics, a nod to Buddy Holly in the form of the smoothed-out rave-up “The Apartment Song,” and a reverent cover of the Byrds’ chiming 1965 single “I’ll Feel a Whole Lot Better,” which either kicks off Side Two of the album or follows the Petty-narrated pause that the singer helpfully inserted for CD listeners who might not get full experience of actually sitting with an album, paying attention to its nuances instead of letting it burble in the background. But it’s not an entirely besotted romance: “Zombie Zoo,” a drowsy kids-these-days lament, was inspired by Petty meeting punks who haunted a club night of the same name—Petty’s portrayal of the white-lipstick “little freak[s]” is a bit condescending (“It’s so hard to be careful, so easy to be led/Somewhere beyond the pavement/You’ll find the living dead,” he notes)—the first fissures in the rock generation gap that would eventually become fodder for his public persona.
MCA Records, Petty’s label at the time, initially rejected Full Moon Fever; once it did come out, it spawned five singles that reached the Hot 100 and sold five million copies. “I waited awhile, until the top regime at the record company changed,” he told Esquire in 2006, echoing the steely-eyed Full Moon Fever smash “I Won’t Back Down,” which uses backing vocals from Lynne, Epstein, and Harrison (Petty and Lynne’s eventual bandmate in the Traveling Wilburys) to bolster Petty’s case for staying steadfast in his beliefs.
But the damage to the label-artist relationship had already been done, and Petty signed with Warner Bros. in a deal that wouldn’t become common knowledge until two years after it was signed. Full Moon Fever, in a twist that made the early executive apathy toward it become a setup for poetic justice, became one of the late 20th century’s most storied rock albums, a stripped-down, yet richly realized presentation of the man behind the stadium-headlining star.

Wildflowers,Tom Petty,1994,8.8,"When he was 44 years old, Tom Petty released his second and greatest solo album. It is a crucial entry to his catalog, one whose songwriting is elegantly spare, personal, and intuitive.
","In the opening verse of “To Find a Friend,” Tom Petty lays out the narrative for his long, messy, exquisite solo album Wildflowers:

In the middle of his life
He left his wife
And ran off to be bad
Boy, it was sad

Petty was 44 when he released his second solo album in the autumn of 1994. He was headed toward a rough divorce from Jane Benyo, his wife of over two decades, with whom he had two daughters. According to Warren Zanes’ biography Petty, he was also on the verge of a pretty serious heroin addiction. At the same time, music was flowing from him like never before: song after song, constant waves of inspiration, words writing themselves. For two years, he practically lived in the studio. Legend has it, the hour-plus album was originally slated to be twice as long with an additional disc of material attached. The release of that music—an archival project that was allegedly one of Petty’s final endeavors—is uncertain. For now, at least, we have Wildflowers.
Wildflowers is not Tom Petty’s tightest album, nor his easiest to listen to. There’s hopelessness and anger; disappointment and regret. Its disparate modes—blues, country, folk, power-pop, torch songs—are connected by the roads, both literal and figurative, that led him to where he found himself: lonely, middle-aged, digging through his consciousness as one would ransack a room to find a small, lost object. “You were so cool back in high school,” he sings smoothly in the last song before switching to his frank, Southern speaking voice: “What happened?” He asks the question and deflates with no hint of poetry or romance, let alone an answer.
Unlike most of his classic rock forebearers, Petty never quite had a “lost era.” He never floundered like Dylan in the ’80s or Springsteen in the ’90s. Instead, he attacked and retreated more consistently. That’s partially why Wildflowers—which followed his commercially successful but creatively scatterbrained record with the Heartbreakers, Into the Great Wide Open—doesn’t receive the widespread accolades of similar later-career masterpieces like Time Out of Mind. Yet, Wildflowers is just as crucial to his discography. It’s impossible to understand the span of Petty’s work without considering these songs: the haunted singalongs that sat next to each other with the stacked, collage-logic flow of a killer concert setlist.
In tone and structure, Wildflowers recalls Neil Young’s 1970 album After the Gold Rush. Petty’s lyrics are simple and intuitive (“In the middle of his life/He left his wife”), spoken as plainly as possible. Yet every word comes alive, speaking multitudes. “Don’t be afraid anymore,” he sings in one song, “It’s only a broken heart.” Young once sang something similar, employing the second-person to place himself as the distanced narrator, the wiser voice offering sage advice. But did anyone buy it? You don’t write songs like these when you’re standing back trying to see the big picture: You write them when you’re in the middle of it, unraveling, talking to yourself, looking for a friend.
Wildflowers was recorded with Rick Rubin, one of Petty’s defining producer partnerships along with Jimmy Iovine and ELO’s Jeff Lynne. But while Lynne spoke to the pop romantic in Petty—the one who envisioned the immortal opening chord of “Free Fallin’” as an army of acoustic guitarists in tie-dye t-shirts playing simultaneously on a cliffside at dusk—Rubin spoke to the nihilist. There’s an unexpected aural twist in nearly every song on Wildflowers: the devastating, string-accompanied outro of “It’s Good to Be King” that makes for the most gorgeous 60 seconds on any Tom Petty record; the seemingly improvised spoken asides during the guitar solos in “Honey Bee”; the warm synths laid over “Time to Move On” that make it sound like he’s singing from underwater. And while it would be reductive to say that Rubin simply lent Petty a loose, stripped-back approach, Petty’s music had never sounded more nakedly reflective of his mental state.
Discussing the making of the album in a recent interview, Rubin recalled Petty playing him a tape of demos, interrupting to pick up his guitar and write an entirely new song on the spot, inspired by hearing his own words played back at him. The album, decades later, still reflects that persistent intensity. In his lyrics, Petty sometimes suggests a sense of spiritual enlightenment (“We gotta get to a higher place”), but it comes out anxious and impatient (“We gotta leave by night”), as if the answer was just on the tip of his tongue, in the next song, the next word. “I’m afraid of that album,” Petty admitted to Rubin. Sometimes he sounds out of control, driven by something deep within him. His daughter Adria once said that, upon hearing the record, she instantly knew that her parents’ marriage was over. It’s all there in Petty’s voice, desperate to be understood and echoed by those who heard their own sad story in it.

Shades of a Blue Orphanage/Vagabonds of the Western World,Thin Lizzy,1972/2015,6.3,"Thin Lizzy's pre-breakthrough albums Shades of a Blue Orphange and Vagabonds of the Western World have been ignored by classic-rock radio playlists and their existence is rarely acknowledged even by the band’s infinite stream of compilations and live albums. Both have been reissued by Light in the Attic.
","As much as classic-rock radio purports to be the last bastion of Real Music, the format is, of course, just as formulaic, repetitive, and popularity-driven as any Top 40 station. Classic-rock radio doesn’t honor veteran bands’ legacies; it contracts and distorts them, reducing diverse multi-decade careers to one or two focus tracks. And because of this, a lot of people have been raised to believe that Thin Lizzy were a hard-rock band, thanks to the only two songs of theirs you’ve been liable to hear on a North American terrestrial rock station over the past 30 years. But as the missing link between Van Morrison and Van Halen, the Irish outfit were really a sensitive soul band who rocked hard as a defense mechanism, shielding the late Phil Lynott’s sad-eyed, streetwise narratives in a molten, harmonic twin-guitar attack that anticipated heavy metal without ever fully hardening into it. And while Lizzy’s sharp-angled logo fit in right next to the KISS and AC/DC patches on your older brother’s denim jacket, Lynott was the rare arena-rocker who wasn’t shrieking to hit the cheap seats—he was singing about the sort of poor bastards stuck in them.
That underdog mentality has made Thin Lizzy perhaps the only band of chest-baring, leather-panted '70s rockers to be unironically embraced in the more humble environs of indie rock, having been namedropped in song by Belle and Sebastian and the Hold Steady, covered by the Mountain Goats, and lovingly imitated by Ted Leo. And the band’s eclectic palette of formative influences, not to mention their unique socio-political dynamic (with a half-black frontman, and members from both sides of Ireland’s Catholic/Protestant divide) go a long way in explaining why their early Decca Records catalogue is currently being reissued on vinyl by the astute historical preservationists at Light In the Attic, as opposed to some major-label bargain-bin CD run.
Like Thin Lizzy's 1971 debut (reissued by LITA in 2012), Shades of a Blue Orphange (1972) and Vagabonds of the Western World (1973) have been ignored by classic-rock radio playlists, and their existence is rarely acknowledged even by the band’s infinite stream of compilations and live albums. The Thin Lizzy represented here—the early trio formation of Lynott, drummer Brian Downey, and ex-Them guitarist Eric Bell—found themselves in the same position as many other blues-schooled rock bands at the dawn of the post-hippie '70s: aesthetically confused and willing to try anything in hope something would stick (all while surreptitiously recording entire albums of Deep Purple covers to pay the bills). And while neither of these albums is wholly rewarding enough to qualify as an overlooked classic, they’re still illuminating documents of a hard-luck band finding its voice for the first time, if only in fits and starts.
As Shades of a Blue Orphanage makes abundantly clear from the get-go, Thin Lizzy weren’t lacking ambition at this stage, but rather direction: Album opener ""The Rise and Dear Demise of the Funky Nomadic Tribes"" is every bit as ridiculous and unwieldy as its title suggests, cycling through tough funk grooves, proto-metal riffage, and progged-out breakdowns en route to a drum solo that fades out unceremoniously at the seven-minute mark. But the track is also something of a red herring, an early, clumsy stab at heaviosity from a band that, at this point, had a much better grasp of intimacy. Even though Thin Lizzy’s sound had yet to settle into place—variously taking the form of ersatz Elvis exercises (""I Don’t Want to Forget How to Drive""), pavement-splitting rockers (""Call the Police""), Astral Weeks-esque folk reveries (""Chatting Today"") and ethereal piano lullabies (""Sarah"")—Lynott’s lyrical voice was already providing a sturdy anchor to rally it around. On richly detailed character studies like ""Buffalo Gal"" and the hymn-like title track, the then-23-year-old Lynott was already singing with the rueful wisdom of a man several decades his senior, laying the foundation for the rugged-romantic archetype that would define his legend.
While Shades of a Blue Orphanage did little to reverse the band’s flagging fortunes, its follow-up single—a glammed-up cover of the traditional Irish standard ""Whiskey in the Jar""—gave Thin Lizzy its first UK hit single in 1972. But that success would not boost the commercial prospects of the band’s next full-length, Vagabonds of the Western World. Fearing that ""Whiskey"" was a novelty hit that didn’t truly reflect the band’s sound, Thin Lizzy refused to include the song on the record. Which is kind of funny in retrospect, since the great breakthrough Thin Lizzy made on ""Whiskey""—in the form of Bell’s thick, mercurial guitar hook—provided them with a new sonic blueprint.
Thin Lizzy had yet to divest itself of all its hare-brained ideas—the spoken-word, psych-funk workout ""The Hero and the Madmen"" may fancy itself a western-themed storybook epic, but it sure as hell ain’t no ""Cowboy Song"". They were, however, starting to kick out the jams with greater confidence and consistency. When Lynott shouts ""I’m a rocker!"", it’s no mere crotch-grabbing macho posturing; it’s the sound of a spiritually adrift musician ecstatically discovering his true calling. (Accordingly, the song in question, ""Rocker"", was the one tune from this era to keep its place on the band’s set lists long enough to warrant inclusion on the band’s definitive 1978 concert document, Live and Dangerous.) And though Bell would depart soon after the album’s release, his sweet, swirling leads on the swinging opener ""Mama Nature Said"", the gorgeous soul serenade ""Little Girl in Bloom"", and the storming title track laid down the gasoline trail that Lizzy’s future dream-team tandem of Brian Robertson and Scott Gorham would set ablaze. Respectively, the best songs on Shades of a Blue Orphanage and Vagabonds of the Western World displayed the early, indecisive Thin Lizzy's facility with wobbly barstool ballads and swaggering, hot-wired rockers. Their greatest victories would come once they started hitting both targets at the same time.

Thelonious Monk: Les Liaisons Dangereuses 1960,Thelonious Monk,2017,8.7,"In 1959, Thelonious Monk recorded selections from his songbook for the soundtrack to French director Roger Vadim’s film Les Liaisons Dangereuses. The lost tapes were never released until now.
","There have been many exceptional eras in jazz history—we’re in one now, in fact—but no one year reverberated like 1959. Miles Davis recorded Kind of Blue, John Coltrane made Giant Steps, Charles Mingus released Mingus Ah Um, and Ornette Coleman barnstormed into New York and unleashed The Shape of Jazz to Come.
Thelonious Monk, as Rushmore-worthy as those others, put out no less than three albums, all in a variety of settings: the large ensemble At Town Hall; 5 by Monk by 5 with his quintet; and the solo Thelonious Alone in San Francisco. If these were not as monumental as the aforementioned—or as brilliant as his own Brilliant Corners from 1957—then they showcased his vast breadth as a truly original pianist, bandleader, and above all, as a writer. His many virtues are underscored again with the unveiling of yet another recording he made that year: the soundtrack for Roger Vadim’s film Les Liaisons Dangereuses, itself an adaptation of Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’ 18th century novel. Improbably lost to the world, the recordings were never released on their own until now, on the centennial of Monk’s birth. If 1959 was a summit in jazz, it may also have marked, on balance, Monk’s annus mirabilis.
Thelonious Monk: Les Liaisons Dangereuses 1960—a limited-edition double-LP and 2xCD set—was produced by Zev Feldman, François Le Xuan, and Frederic Thomas for the independent Sam Records and Saga labels with full permission from Monk’s estate. It’s bolstered by notes from scholars including Robin D.G. Kelley, author of Thelonious Monk: The Life and Times of an American Original, as well as photographs from the session, which took place down the block from Carnegie Hall at Nola Penthouse Studio on 111 West 57th Street. (Monk being Monk, he wore a conical hat during the date.)
Jazz had such pan-cultural appeal in the late 1950s that Duke Ellington had a cameo in Otto Preminger’s Anatomy of a Murder, for which he also did the music; Mingus scored John Cassavetes’ directorial debut, Shadows; and Miles did the memorable soundtrack for Ascenseur Pour L’Échafaud. Even Vadim, whose personal life was more interesting than his life’s work—his two autobiographies were titled Memoirs of the Devil and Bardot, Deneuve, and Fonda: My Life With the Three Most Beautiful Women in the World—used the Modern Jazz Quartet to compose the music for another of his erotic dramas, No Sun in Venice, two years earlier.
Despite some personal and professional issues he was dealing with, Monk was in top form on this mid-summer day—spry, full of wit, his ideas delightfully unpredictable as ever. The photos show that his wife Nellie—his rock—was there as was his patron, the Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter. His band was made up of Sam Jones on bass, Art Taylor on drums, tenor saxophonist Charlie Rouse, who would go on to be his loyal soldier for years to come, and another tenor, Barney Wilen, which is how these tapes were discovered. The producers found them while combing Wilen’s archives in search of unreleased material the Frenchman might have left behind.
By the time Monk agreed to record, there was no time to write original music so he dipped into his own songbook: two versions each of “Crepuscule With Nellie,” “Well, You Needn’t,” “Light Blue,” and “Rhythm-a-Ning” (the first of which sounds as nimble and alive as any he’d done). Monk did no less than four versions of “Pannonica,” plus “Ba-Lue Bolivar Ba-Lues-Are,” “Six in One,” and the hymn “We’ll Understand It Better By and By.” What might have been monotonous in other hands provided ample opportunity for Monk, who wrote music with acres of room for his improvisational pivots.
Indeed, the music works better as an album than a soundtrack, though it’s clear Vadim had real affection for jazz. “Crepuscule With Nellie” plays over the opening credits, followed immediately by “Well, You Needn’t,” and soon after “Bolivar Ba-Lues-Are.” There’s even a scene with jazz musicians Kenny Clarke, Kenny Dorham, Paul Rovère, Barney Wilen, and Duke Jordan, who also composed music for the film (though it’s not included in this set). But the soundtrack often intrudes and overwhelms some sections of the movie, whether during a party scene or at a ski resort or in a bedroom.
On Les Liaisons Dangereuses 1960, Monk is a heavyweight engaging with a middleweight, and middlebrow, in Vadim, whose career was more defined by his romantic conquests than his artistic content. But that’s not on Monk. And his work here, in the middle of 1959, is as thought-provoking as anything he recorded in that prodigious year.

With its tinny mix and Fruity Loops-style finger snaps and steel drums, you can easily imagine the whole thing being made on a high school computer lab’s Dell desktop. His rushed vocals, meanwhile, sound recorded in a bedroom closet just before his mom forced him to do his homework. And yet the Texas rapper has established himself 2019’s king of dance rap.
His journey picked up momentum in late 2017, when he uploaded “WERKKK” to the YouTube page of Texas-based videographer and dance video host JMoney1041. The song served as a widespread introduction to Tisakorean’s startling screeches and sinister whispering, inspired by Texas dance rap staples like Yung Nation. He followed up “WERKKK” with “Dip,” a song that found success soundtracking a Dallas-Fort Worth area dance craze called “The Woah” on social media—eventually getting the Lil Uzi Vert remix treatment. But his social media ascent was solidified when he hollered, murmured, and danced his way into virality in an ongoing series of Instagram freestyles.
In the mold of a teenage Soulja Boy, Tisakorean’s A Guide To Being A Partying Freshman—featuring a mixtape cover influenced by the YA novel Diary of a Wimpy Kid—is packed with brief minimalist tracks about school, made to be danced to on social media apps like Triller, TikTok, and Instagram. The goal is virality, but there’s a refreshing innocence to the project. Nothing is polished and nothing feels forced. Tisakorean’s lyrics are mostly irrelevant. His voice is just another instrument in the mix—one that I’m not sure he always knows how to use—with constantly changing volumes and melodies as he falls in love in the school hallway on “Gabby (Booty in the Hallway).”
A Guide To Being A Partying Freshman’s issues are minimal. One is the Kenny Beats-produced “Apple Sauce” which feels too slick and sticks out. Another is “Where’s Ms. Juicy (Hamburger Booty)” in which Tisakorean takes the Soulja Boy influence too far, with horns that need to stay locked up in a mid-2000s Atlanta time capsule. But those moments don’t prevent Tisakorean from creating one of the first mixtapes that can be enjoyed on Instagram, TikTok, and Triller. So pick any song from A Guide To Being A Partying Freshman, download the Triller app, mimic Uzi, and experience Tisakorean the way you’re supposed to.

Songs From the Big Chair,Tears for Fears,1985,8.9,"Tears for Fears’ second album is the one sound of pop-rock in the ’80s. Its personal psychology, meticulous compositions, and world-sized choruses evoked the loss of control in an overwhelming era.
","Welcome to your life. From the moment you enter the world, you’re traumatized, first by your very birth, then by every subsequent moment of your existence, each of which will have a profound and significant effect on your behavior; in childhood, when you experience emotional distress, that pain remains, buried underneath time and memory.
In 1970, the psychologist Arthur Janov published The Primal Scream, in which he detailed his theory that the neuroses and baggage that adults carry with them are caused by repressed traumatic events from childhood. The same year, John Lennon and Yoko Ono underwent therapy sessions with Janov for about five months. Lennon channeled his experiences into his solo debut, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. He created one album out of his encounters with Janov; Tears for Fears based their entire career off of Janov’s work.
Even the band’s name is derived from The Primal Scream, on a theory of children’s nightmares. “Basically, if they are allowed to be themselves in their waking hours and are allowed to let their natural crying out, then they won’t dream up monsters at night to be scared of because they can’t face the reality of being scared of their parents,” bassist and co-singer Curt Smith told Will Hall, the author of Tears for Fears . . . Tales From the Big Chair. “Since emotional stress is the central issue here, the solution... is to encourage an emotional response so intense that the years of hidden anger and hurt are allowed to surface from the depths of the unconscious.”
On their second LP, 1985’s Songs From the Big Chair, Tears for Fears took a cue from Lennon and applied what they’d learned from Janov toward studies of single subjects: money, power, love, war, faith. But where Lennon went small, Tears for Fears went huge. They took the goth and synth-pop foundation they constructed on their debut, 1983’s The Hurting, and piled on saxophone, Fairlights, guitar solos, samplers, and live drums on top of drum machines. They wrote cresting choruses, arena-ready anthems, elegant ballads, and multi-section songs that have more in common with prog-rock than most of new wave. And they improbably created not just one of the biggest albums of the 1980s, but an album that manages to exude the 1980s in the same way that Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours conveys the lonely narcissism and hedonism of the ’70s, or Love’s Forever Changes captures both the bliss and the ominousness of the Summer of Love.
When Smith and Tears for Fears co-singer, guitarist, and principal songwriter Roland Orzabal went to record Songs From the Big Chair, the two possessed the kind of ambition necessary to produce an era-defining album. More than anything, Tears for Fears felt like they had something to prove to both critics and to themselves.
The Hurting went to number one on the UK album charts, sold a million copies, and yielded three top-five singles—“Mad World,” “Pale Shelter,” and “Change”—but the UK music press approached it with near hostility. In his review of the album for NME, Gavin Martin writes, “Sure, they may be popular—so was the Reverend Jim Jones when he took 5,000 followers to Guyana to commit mass suicide.” Orzabal told The Quietus, in an interview, “We weren’t particularly liked by some of the music journals. If you were on the front cover of Smash Hits, you were doomed.”
Part of the problem was that Tears for Fears came off as being too sincere—The Hurting was so explicit about its debt to Janov and The Primal Scream, and so lacking in subtlety, that the album cover depicted a child holding his head in his hands. But that sincerity belies the cosmetic gloss of the music. With its gleaming synthesizers, tight drum-machine programming, and minor-key melodies, The Hurting is a hallmark of early-80s dark wave and goth. That beauty came with a price: “It ended up taking a lot of time and costing a lot of money because we were fussy,” Smith told Hall. “The problem with it taking so long was that when we looked back at tracks we’d done months before we’d think, ‘Ooh, I don’t like that.’”
For Songs From the Big Chair, the band regrouped at their keyboardist Ian Stanley’s home studio in Somerset and rehired Chris Hughes, who also produced The Hurting. After a few false starts, Orzabal formed a brain trust of himself, Hughes, and Stanley, with Dave Bascombe providing engineering assistance and Smith signing off on ideas and making suggestions. They took inspiration from the music they were listening to, cerebral art-rock by Talking Heads, Brian Eno, Robert Wyatt, and Peter Gabriel. Smith confessed that his favorite album at the time was the Blue Nile’s A Walk Across the Rooftops. He could tell the Blue Nile had total artistic control—the music sounded calculated, finessed, meticulous.
In the documentary Scenes From the Big Chair, Orzabal revealed that the method Tears for Fears adopted was “fitting songs into interesting sounds.” To create the sounds, the squad in Somerset set up a formidable assembly of equipment: “a LinnDrum II box, a Drumulator drum box, a Roland Super Jupiter synthesizer, a Fairlight synthesizer, a DX7 keyboard, a rack of guitars, a Steinberger Bass, a Fender Stratocaster and a Gretsch maple drum kit,” according to Hughes. The main foursome would go in the studio from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., five days a week. They started by experimenting with individual fragments and then building them out. They took their time and loosened up their approach. Most importantly, they enjoyed themselves.
No track on Songs From the Big Chair exemplifies this free-roaming, tessellating approach more than its opener, the No. 1 single “Shout.” As Hughes told RBMA, “[Roland] set up a little drum box and a little synthesizer with a bass tone. He pressed the button on the drum box, and he programmed this little beat and it had these little chimey bells and a clapping drum beat. He pressed one of the keys and started singing, ‘Shout. Shout. Let it all out.’”
The template was an opportunity for Hughes, Orzabal, and Stanley to indulge. The structure of “Shout” is minimal, just one or two vocal melodies played over a steady drumbeat for around six-and-a-half minutes. But the thrust of the song is repetition, because as the hook grows and grows, the band keeps adding patches and instruments that compound the potency of the songwriting: a Fairlight-programmed ghostly synth-flute line, chippy guitar licks, and then a perfectly timed breakdown at 2:40, with a warped keyboard patch followed by a huge rush of Hammond organ and then a return to that earlier synth-flute, in a sequence that sounds like a brass band bursting through, then all of it blanketed by heavy-feedback guitars and backup vocals, a knifelike guitar solo running on top, and Orzabal and Smith still singing: “Shout. Shout. Let it all out/These are the things I can do without.”
“Shout” sounds tough. The drumbeat has an industrial, boxy shape and texture that resembles a march, with Orzabal and Smith’s joint vocals delivered almost as a chant. The song is just as explicit about primal therapy as virtually any other Tears for Fears track that predates it. But it’s less egregious, even though the execution is more direct. From the outset, Tears for Fears sound like they have a real purpose. The end of the verse is a declaration: I’m talking to you.
Tears for Fears named Songs From the Big Chair after the 1976 TV movie Sybil, in which Sally Field plays the title character, a woman with multiple personality disorder who could only prevent herself from using her different guises as defense mechanisms when she was sitting in her analyst’s chair. But the title also smartly references the music—because the songs all pertain to different sides of Tears for Fears’ personality—and that the band are delivering the album from an assured psychological state.
Tears for Fears could harness their self-confidence for a variety of tones and subjects, something that’s evident on “Head Over Heels,” another one of Songs From the Big Chair’s major singles. Whereas “Shout” is brooding and martial, “Head Over Heels” is dreamy and skeptical, with its glimpses of the joys of relationship chitchat (“I wanted to be with you alone /And talk about the weather”) and its swooning chorus, clouded in the band’s heavy, misty production. The music contradicts the narrative, in which the protagonist sabotages courtship because of his own self-hatred (“I made a fire, I’m watching it burn/I thought of your future”) and doubts that he can ever truly be in love (“I’m lost in admiration, could I need you this much?”). At this point, Tears for Fears could address their own insecurities without appearing wimpy or self-absorbed.
Songs From the Big Chair’s two ballads, “I Believe” and “Listen,” also manage to avoid preciousness or campiness, impressive because they’re the two parts of the album that most expose Tears for Fears’ love of progressive art-rock. “I Believe,” a gentle track that sounds like it was recorded in a piano bar, greatly resembles Robert Wyatt’s quirky, curling songwriting. The band is forthright about Wyatt’s influence, as corroborated by their engrossing, bare-bones cover of the singer-songwriter’s “Sea Song,” the B-side to “I Believe.” On the symphonic, largely instrumental “Listen,” pockets of blobby keyboard and electric guitar course through the song, with a world-music chorus at the end that sounds like a mash-up of Gabriel’s Security and Jon Hassell and Eno’s Fourth World Vol. 1: Possible Musics.
The first two verses of “Listen” also address the then-ongoing Cold War, and Songs From the Big Chair finds Tears for Fears engaging with politics more than ever before. On their first single, the propulsive “Mothers Talk,” the band juxtapose themes of motherhood with protests against nuclear war (“But when the weather starts to burn /Then you’ll know that you’re in trouble”), a canny insinuation that unresolved maternal issues lead to violence. On the simmering, nocturnal “The Working Hour,” Orzabal takes on the music business; its chorus, “This is the working hour/We are paid by those who learn by our mistakes,” straight-up calls out how record companies turn fun and creativity into manual labor and profit from it in the process.
Tears for Fears synthesize all of the threads on Songs From the Big Chair—intricacy, romance, psychology, and politics—on the album’s centerpiece, the everlasting “Everybody Wants to Rule the World.” Hughes says that he, Orzabal, and Stanley put the song together in a week, astonishing because the track has so many components: the twinkling synth at the beginning joined by a spider-like guitar, the snappy instrumental lead-up to the opening verse, the shuffling drum beat, the chorus, the galvanizing bridge, a moody instrumental passage, a guitar solo, a new melody for a verse afterwards, another guitar solo. And the genius of “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” is how it escalates, how each part increasingly amplifies the passion of the music.
More than any other Tears for Fears track, “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” most successfully transposes Janov’s psychological texts into a pop song with global resonance. Though “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” is obviously a meditation on power, you could project virtually every major issue of the 1980s onto the lyrics: the environment (“Turn your back on mother nature”), the fleeting nature of financial success (“Help me make the most of freedom and of pleasure/Nothing ever lasts forever”), authoritarian rule (“Even while we sleep/We will find you”), and the Cold War (“Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down”).
“Everybody Wants to Rule the World” is a song with a near-universal appeal, and likewise Songs From the Big Chair seemed to resonate with everyone—jocks, goths, pre-teens, adults. “At our gigs, you’ll get young girls at the front, the Joy Division fans at the back and even some hippies putting in an appearance,” Smith told Hall. “Our fan mail is certainly very varied, containing letters from everyone from twelve-year-old girls to mothers with five-year-old daughters.”
It took four years for Tears for Fears to follow up Songs From the Big Chair, and what came out of it was The Seeds of Love, an overambitious, elaborate, refined, and somewhat underrated album. Orzabal supposedly alienated everyone—Smith, Hughes, and Stanley—during its production, mostly due to his perfectionism. For a while, it seemed Tears for Fears had faded away, a relic of an era too gauche to respect anymore. The only place you might find them was on “Dennis Miller Live,” which used “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” as its opening theme.
Then, Tears for Fears turned up in an unlikely place: Donnie Darko, a film that subverts ’80s teen movies. “Head Over Heels” is memorably included during a slow-motion montage, but Tears for Fears were mostly rediscovered by younger audiences thanks to Michael Andrews and Gary Jules’ cover of “Mad World.” By peeling away all the circuitry and flash of the original, replacing the gizmos with mostly non-electronic instruments, and slowing the tempo, Andrews and Jules exposed “Mad World” as the post-9/11 emo ballad it was perhaps destined to be. As the 2000s progressed, you’d hear Tears for Fears incrementally more often. In 2008 Kanye West sampled the chorus of The Hurting’s “Memories Fade” on “Coldest Winter,” from 808s & Heartbreak, coincidentally about an artist trying to deal with the death of his mother.
Today you’ll hear “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” all over the place—it’s a staple of classic-rock radio, pharmacies, bars, and parties. But at its core the song is still dealing with Janov; with how, ultimately, what human beings want is control, and the inability to control your own life is misdirected into a desire to overpower other people. It’s a constant with Songs From the Big Chair: interior drama is construed as being about collective suffering. Personal chaos is universal. Welcome to your life. There’s no turning back.

Lover,Taylor Swift,2019,7.1,"On her seventh album, Taylor Swift is a little wiser and a lot more in love. Though uneven, Lover is a bright, fun album with great emotional honesty.
","The theme of Taylor Swift’s Lover is right there in the title. These 18 songs are odes to the things she loves most and knows best: her boyfriend and her mom, the West Village and the West End, and, always and forever on a Taylor Swift album, being in love. It’s an exuberant celebration of the challenges of maintaining a relationship through seasons and across continents, of telling the truth and saying sorry. Swift has always mined her personal life for opaque fables of love and retribution; she memorializes a romance’s fleeting details, wraps them in bows, and ferries them to an audience eager to receive her gifts. She writes about a life that’s strengthened, not broken, by heartbreak. Lover is the suggestion that the right person, the right song, might lift heartbreak from your life, too. The concept is, as she claims early on, both “overdramatic and true.”
Lover nods to 2017’s reputation, but in spirit, it’s the sequel to the synth-pop glitter of 1989. Produced mostly with ubiquitous pop whisperer Jack Antonoff, it’s full of low-lying synthesizer pulses and reverbed beats that can feel more like scaffolding than full songs. Sometimes it attempts to honor Swift’s entire artistic journey at once: The waltzing “Lover,” full of fiddle and fairytale weddings, harks back to the Old Taylor; “I Think He Knows” is a thumping electro-pop shout-out to Nashville’s Music Row. She uses the word “shade” twice, up from once on reputation. She’s 29, but she still writes metaphors about prom dresses and homecoming queens. It’s bright and fun and occasionally cloying.
Lover’s emotional peaks and valleys are higher and deeper than reputation, where romance played out under a long shadow of doubt. Opener “I Forgot That You Existed” is a hopscotch rhythm set to a rhyme like you’d leave in your nemesis’ yearbook if you were really being honest—which is to say, it doesn’t sound like she forgot for one second. It comes off as throat-clearing, but it opens a stretch of drama-free delights, like the magnetic pink glow of “Cruel Summer” (“I don’t want to keep secrets just to keep you!”) and the crystal-ball clarity of “The Archer,” with its elegant, Chromatics-esque synthesizer build and self-aware regret: “I cut off my nose just to spite my face/And I hate my reflection for years and years.” The exception is undercooked gender-equality anthem “The Man,” a song that hilariously, unironically points to Leonardo DiCaprio’s playboy image as the height of masculine privilege, and proves that other people shouldn’t write Kesha songs.
Is it the prickly cotton-candy production or the lyrical detail or the vocal echo or just the event album-ness of it all that keeps Lover in the foreground, song after song? With the possible exception of the steel drums on music-box oddball “It’s Nice to Have a Friend,” the album never claims any new ground; some of its best moments are unavoidably familiar. Rihanna or Robyn might intend their new music to sound entirely fresh; Swift, our most conventional pop star, builds atop what has worked already. And with Antonoff behind so much of the sound of pop music in the latter half of the decade, the bold, ’80s-inspired style isn’t inherently more interesting or varied than any other. “I Think He Knows” sounds like Carly Rae Jepsen; “The Archer” sounds like Lorde’s “Supercut”; “Miss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince,” actually a Joel Little joint, sounds like Lana Del Rey’s Born to Die.
Swift and her collaborators try some real doozies: Pop-punk marriage proposal “Paper Rings” has a key change borrowed from the Shangri-Las and more than a little acoustic guitar in the mix. It’s cute, and then exhausting. The perky, England-themed “London Boy” begins sweetly—“I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent”—but devolves into a parade of rugby and high tea and “I fancy you”s, a love song as predictable as one of Mary-Kate and Ashley’s direct-to-video European adventures. She samples Idris Elba joking about taking James Corden on a scooter ride, apropos of nothing except that he says “London.” I can only imagine what it sounds like to a Brit.
“London Boy” is relentlessly upbeat, but the next mood swing will knock you sideways: It’s “Soon You’ll Get Better,” a heartrending ballad about Swift’s mother’s ongoing cancer battle, with background harmonies by the Dixie Chicks. Three minutes later, her tender testimony of new faith is outshined by the terrific “False God,” a moody sophistipop meditation on transatlantic romance where worship (“Religion’s in your lips… the altar is my hips”) sounds more like a metaphor for…. oral sex? On a Taylor Swift album? Am I losing my mind? Then “You Need to Calm Down” crashes in to remind us that she also considers making nice with Katy Perry to be a form of activism.
Because Swift is better when she’s learning than when she’s trying to teach us a lesson, Lover’s garish lead singles contribute to the strain. I’ve thought about “ME!” every day for four months; it still sounds like a musical number taken out of context, just unearned celebratory fanfare without plot or character development, so dead-eyed it’s spooky. But she’s better when she gives herself real space to think, as on “Cornelia Street,” a lovely, understated tribute to memory and nostalgia with the power to make one rarefied block of Manhattan feel universal.
Like Red or Speak Now, Lover is a sprawling scrapbook of invisible personal bookmarks, an escapist fantasy about a real-life celebrity boyfriend, a shrewd self-mythology disguised as a benevolent offering. It’s probably five bad songs away from being better than 1989. It’s also a little wiser and more emotionally honest. “I once believed love would be black and white… I once believed love would be burning red/But it’s golden,” she sings on dreamy pastel closer “Daylight,” replacing the fiery passion of Red with a gentler, more mature understanding of true love as a good idea you don’t want to stop having. Heartbreak can strengthen you; love sustains you. If only all of Lover had the same heart.

Devotion,Laura Jean,2018,6.8,"The Australian folk-turned-pop singer revisits her eccentric, romantically unfulfilled teen years on an album that reaches for the coming-of-age immediacy of artists like Lorde and Taylor Swift.
","Laura Jean opens her fifth album, Devotion, with a spectacular orchestral flourish—the kind that might signal the beginning of a dream sequence in an old movie musical. She sings as if in a daze about stolen glances and trepid desire, her words lifted skyward by synthetic strings and weightless, arpeggiating piano. The transportive song, “Press Play,” signals that listeners should rid themselves of any assumptions regarding the record’s grounding in Jean’s current reality.
The 36-year-old Australian folk-turned-pop singer long ago reached an age at which the episodes recounted in “Press Play,” involving “popular girls” and watching crushes stare out of school bus windows, faded from her day-to-day life. But Jean wrote Devotion as a tribute to her teenage years, a time when she was, by her own description, “eccentric” and “romantically-unfulfilled.” Throughout the album, she revisits her nascent sexuality and formative obsessions without glossing over her younger self’s complex emotional life, the way adult artists often do when depicting teens. Devotion is nostalgic by its very nature—yet, at its best, the album captures the experiences of first love and lust with remarkable immediacy, rather than the fuzzed-out romanticism of hindsight.
Jean’s retrospective gaze is especially sharp on “Girls on the TV,” which narrates a childhood friendship with a girl she calls “Ricky.” In adolescence, Ricky weathered her share of storms—bullying, drugs, sexual harassment—and Jean recounts them with both anguish and fierce optimism. Other songs on the album lack such robust narratives, but the vibrance of Jean’s storytelling is consistent; she has a way of surfacing small, unexpected details that often say more about a moment than endless exposition can. It’s a skill she shares with some of the best chroniclers of teen romance. When she sings, “I smell the humidity of the concrete,” while describing a budding dalliance on “Northerly,” she taps into the same sensory bliss that makes the opening lines of Taylor Swift’s “Fearless” so captivating. Lorde has praised Devotion’s lead single, “Touchstone,” for its eloquent “communication of the spooky, all-consuming nature of feminine love”—a subject the track shares with some of Lorde’s own songs, like “Writer in the Dark.”
Swift and Lorde documented their respective comings-of-age from different corners of the youth-obsessed pop space, and it’s fitting that Jean’s embrace of this same subject matter finds her straying from her folk roots, in favor of more pop-oriented sounds. When it comes to instrumentation, the transition feels natural: Jean’s voice is light enough to blend in with the pillowy synths she introduces and nimble enough to keep pace with upshifted percussion.
There are moments, however, when pop magic proves elusive. The success of songs like the ones on Devotion (and Fearless, and Melodrama) is often determined by the strength of their hooks. Pushed to write slicker, stickier tracks than ever before, Jean sometimes comes up short. At times, her attempts at lyrical simplicity yield extreme reductiveness: On “Which One Are You?,” she splits humanity into a series of binaries, then dreamily wonders which group her paramour falls into. Reaching for universal resonance, she grasps clichéd language instead.
In chronicling teen romance, Jean has taken on one of pop culture’s most commodified, trope-laden subjects. But it’s only when she leans into specificity and idiosyncrasy, rather than single-mindedly courting wide appeal, that she captures the spectacular novelty that makes young love worth revisiting in the first place.

Journey Through a Burning Brain (Anthology),Tangerine Dream,2002,4.9,"There's a case to be made for Tangerine Dream as being among the most\n\ historically important experimental German ...
","There's a case to be made for Tangerine Dream as being among the most historically important experimental German bands from the early 70s. Beyond the fact that their mastery of all manner of synthesizer technology predated the digital boom in the 80s, they're arguably the grandfathers of ambient music (despite what the church of Eno may preach). Edgar Froese's outfit began as one of many rambunctious noisemakers in Berlin in the late 60s, but has survived as one of the most long-lived groups in rock. Of course, the group has tweaked their sound considerably over the years, and this curious set, containing one disc of early 70s pieces, and two of mid-80s live tracks, makes clear that not every chapter in Froese's manual is required reading.
The first disc in the box contains the most interesting music, by a considerable margin. Covering the underrated early period of the band on Ohr Records (1970-73), the sounds are spacey, spacious and determinedly sprawling. ""Genesis"" and ""Cold Smoke"" are both taken from the band's first release, Electronic Meditation, the only record to feature future kosmiche icons Klaus Schultz and Conrad Schnitzler (later of Kluster). Similar to their peers Guru Guru, Ash Ra Tempel (also featuring Shultz) and Amon Düül II, Tangerine Dream were, at this point, about freeform mind-expansion, and that alone: ""Cold Smoke"" rumbles and skirts via heavily reverbed crashing drums, maniacal violin, post-Hendrix guitar ejaculation and even an excitable vagrant shouting cosmic obscenities in the distance. ""Fly and Collision of Comas Sola"" and ""Sunrise in the Third System"" are taken from the group's second album, Alpha Centauri, with Chris Franke and Steve Schroyder replacing Schultz and Schnitzler. Keyboards began to play a greater part in the arrangements (as well as flute here), but the general ticket was still an acid-laced blur.
In 1972, Tangerine Dream released their early masterpiece, Zeit (featuring Peter Baumann, and completing one of the most longstanding of the band's lineups), and because Castle Music felt the need to whip me into submission with two discs of live meh from the 80s, only one track from that double LP is included. That's too bad, because ""Origin of Supernatural Probabilities"" represents a command of sound on par with the greatest studio masters. The opening guitar chords sound as if they were recorded under two feet of water, and when the synth begins to babble and whales begin to cry, I'd as soon sport gills as leave my stereo. Simply put, 70s electronic music does not get better than this-- unless you count their follow-up, 1973's Atem, of which two pieces are included on this set: The Mellotron-soaked nature hymn ""Fauni Gena"" and an atypical vocal (of sorts) track ""Wahn"", also featuring primal percussion akin to that on the first record.
Now, skip forward about 10 or 12 years to the mid-80s, when Tangerine Dream had become quite a different beast. Gone were the psychedelic trance-outs and echo chambers, replaced by big light shows and Jan Hammer's drum machine. In fact, Froese and company were still playing psychedelic music, but what that meant 20 years removed from the era was much different; they were providing escapists soundtracks for the overstressed and nostalgic alike, far from the boundless ""mind-expansion"" of a bygone time. And yes, I absolutely abhor those crystalline, programmed 80s beats-- Mannheim Steamroller at Christmas is one thing, but I will not stand idly by and listen to men who once tripped like kings through the nether regions of consciousness play crowd-control for yuppies.
That said, if you don't pay attention-- and that's the real difference: early Tangerine Dream was good for escapism and repeated, detail-obsessed listening-- some of this works as decent background pitter-patter. Not surprisingly, the better tracks are the longest: the 22-minute ""Poland"" begins as a practically unlistenable exercise in new age pep, but does have scattered moments of old-fashioned krautrock whim, particularly during the parts that forgo dance beats for drone. And it's not as if Tangerine Dream + dance music is a necessarily bad concept (why hasn't there been a movement to remix these guys, a la Kraftwerk's The Mix or Can's Sacrilege?), but this stuff is perilously close to skincare instructional video soundtracks. Just when I thought it couldn't get worse, disc three drops ""Song of the Whale"", parts one and two! Wow. In summary, skip this set and check out the early Tangerine Dream records instead-- they're all being remastered (with bonus tracks!), hopefully making Journey Through a Burning Brain obsolete sooner rather than later.

Electronic Meditation/Alpha Centauri,Tangerine Dream,1970/2002,7.6,"

","Psychedelic music spawned so many fragmented genres of rock in the late 60s, it's easy to forget that at one point, most of the bands were trying to accomplish the same, basic thing: To change the world with music. Failing that, they might have settled for freaking themselves out, but exploration into the unknown was the key. Peace and love? Sure, sometimes. Surreal visions of the beyond? Check. Crazy backwards guitar solos? Extra nice. This kind of faith in a better tomorrow through experimentation (or at least the aping of experimentation, in the hopes of stumbling over a little second-hand wisdom) is one of the aspects of late-60s music culture that makes it so unique, and consequently why, in many ways, it was the last time rock was free of its own self-conscious ambition.
American and British bands were quick to establish national schools of psychedelia, but continental European bands evolved differently. Countries like Germany and Sweden, far from the epicenters of pop and rock flourish, got their news via weekend radio shows and imported LPs. German guitarist Edgar Froese, playing with a beat combo The Ones, had already formed a long-distance attachment to Jimi Hendrix when he met Salvador Dali, and was inspired to form the earliest version of Tangerine Dream (named after a lyric in The Beatles' ""Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds"") in 1967. Froese met Berlin club owner Conrad Schnitzler, himself a student of avant-garde sculpture and music (via his former teacher Karlheinz Stockhausen), and later, drummer Klaus Schulze. Along with organist Jimmy Jackson, they formed the version of TD that produced their first LP, Electronic Meditation.
TD oozes their way out of the gate with the primordial muck of ""Genesis"": A short, but telling introduction to a world apart from your mom's wholesome rock and roll. Fuzzy guitar flutter and Schulze's rin-tin-tinny cymbal rattle the stage clear for Schnitzler's basso profundo cello moan. That moan, for better or for worse, is the ""melody"" here, and I suppose that makes the quivering electro-effects a counterpoint. Flautist Thomas Keyserling (uncredited on the original release) bubbles here and offers a glissando there; at the height of synergetic convergence, Shulze drops a caveman stomp on the toms. If this was hippie music, it was borne of the most sincerely gone magick available.
The two epics (a compositional preference Froese never abandoned) are ""Cold Smoke"" and ""Journey Through A Burning Brain"", both of which sound much more in tune with music Shulze and Schnitzler would go on to create than anything TD became famous for. In fact, parts of ""Journey"" remind me of each of Schnitzler's Kluster LPs, with unidentified sound effects and a hard-line approach to free improvisation: Any melodies are purely coincidental, and should not detract from the generally horrific vibe. The band does lapse into prototypical krautrock beat-mantra midway through, but makes sure to mix in sufficiently atonal flute soloing, and Froese's boundless, rhythmless guitar stylings. ""Cold Smoke"" begins with a different strategy, one much closer to what most folks think of when TD is mentioned: Keyboard-dominated atmospherics. That strategy lasts for exactly one minute before Shulze's cymbals rip apart the solemn organ chords; the organ tries to come back, and Shulze destroys it again. In the end, things end up fairly similar to the previous tune, though the seeds of a gentler TD have been planted.
""Ashes to Ashes"" takes the organ from ""Cold Smoke"" and adds some Doors-ish cocktail-rock drumming, and of course, more free guitar and flute. On Electronic Meditation, this tune is as close to rock as the group played, and in places is not unlike concurrent Grateful Dead (or more accurately, Amon Duul II). ""Resurrection"" tidies up the biblical concept with church organ and a backwards sermon (devilish!), and a return of the gooey acid-ballet of the opening song (hereby allowing TD to corner the market on psychedelic, freeform biblical concept albums from Germany). It was a far cry from the mystical impressionism of their mid-70s LPs (with only Froese remaining from this trio), and anyone who thinks the band is good for little more than New Age background moods will be surprised by this music.
Shulze left the band before Electronic Meditation was released, and Schnitzler stayed on only long enough to see the induction of 16-year old drummer Chris Franke into the band. Schnitzler's replacement was the rambunctious organist Steve Shroyder (himself a member for only one album). The trio of Froese, Franke and Shroyder (along with two guest musicians) recorded TD's second record, Alpha Centauri, and had little difficulty living up to the freaky promise of the Dream's debut. Pieces like ""Sunrise In the Third System"" (an organ-led mystic processional) and the single (!) ""Ultima Thule Part 1"" (with a very non-TD rock thud) proved the band were learning how to pour maximum mood into more compact structures.
That said, the centerpiece is the massive title-track: Not only does this piece take up the bulk of Alpha Centauri, it's an almost perfect summation of everything they'd accomplished up to that point. Beginning with distant flute, and gigantic cymbal swells, the track (like many before) takes a while to get off the ground, but when Froese's brand new VCS3 synthesizer makes with the siren calls, the outer limits are within reach. Even at this early point, Froese was fascinated with the possibility of the synthesizer, though he hadn't quite mastered its range. Flautist Udo Dennebourg plays a starring role for much of the piece, adding melodic, if flighty, direction to an otherwise malleable form. Dennebourg begins announcing something at the close of the piece, and wordless, choral backing vocals deliver the dark finale.
Each of these records (as well as 1972's Zeit and 1973's Atem) were originally released on Ralf-Ulrich Kaiser's legendary Ohr imprint, also home to the first recordings of Ash Ra Temple, Popol Vuh and Amon Duul. Over the years, Tangerine Dream has undergone a number of personnel changes, and Froese gradually transformed the chaotic Technicolor of his band's first recordings into an altogether different trip. However, as products of the psychedelic era (and the budding German experimental rock scene later dubbed ""krautrock""), these albums are fine nuggets indeed, even if the best was yet to come.

Blue 05 / Blue 06,Forest Drive West,2019,7.5,"A pair of new singles from London’s Whities label demonstrate that there are few better places to take the pulse of adventurous UK club music.
","When the dance-music site Resident Advisor named Whities one of the best labels of 2016, the London imprint was keeping a pretty low profile: It had put out a scant four records that year, adding to the five it had released since launching in 2014. Since then, the label, founded by Nic Tasker, has dialed up the pace. Its catalog is now three dozen releases deep, but it still prefers the shadows to the limelight. Most Whities artists are known primarily to fans on club music’s fringes, if they’re known at all; the biggest names on the roster (Avalon Emerson, Lanark Artefax) got a significant boost in the wake of their Whities debuts.
There are few better places to take the pulse of adventurous UK club music, and that’s especially true of the Whities Blue sublabel, which maintains a slightly more dancefloor-oriented focus than its parent label. Until now, Whities Blue had been dedicated to split singles, but the latest two in the series, from Forest Drive West and Pugilist, respectively, break that mold.
Forest Drive West, aka East London’s Joe Baker, active since 2016, is the better known of the two artists. A typical Forest Drive West production is a good reminder of why dance music tends to use the term “track” in place of “song”: His drum programming stretches out in long, steely, unswerving lines, hi-hats flashing like railroad ties. Rhythmically, his two cuts here are as linear as anything he’s done, but the atmosphere around his drums is in constant flux. “Other” is the heavier of the two tunes, built around booming toms and a beefy, syncopated groove; despite the ample force of his low end, there’s a wealth of high-end detail that lends an electrifying dynamism. (Listen closely and you might hear an echo of Plastikman in the triplet figures rippling across the surface of the mix.) “Time” takes a similar approach into vast metallic clouds of reverb, with taut plucked tones glinting dully in the fog. If the Cure’s “A Forest” were reborn as minimal techno, it might sound something like this.
Melbourne’s Pugilist, aka Alex Dickson, is a relative newcomer; his early productions, from 2017 and 2018, tended toward classic, half-speed dubstep with a decidedly mid-aughts feel. But lately he’s been quickening his tempos, bringing him more in line with his UK bass contemporaries. “Descendant,” the opening track on his EP, recalls Forest Drive West’s linear shapes while incorporating an almost Latin sense of swing; every so often, rushing breakbeats burst like geysers through the surface. For a bass musician, he knows how to make the high end sing: The treble register is a turbulent field of nonstop motion—metallic shrieks, flayed hi-hats, and alien wibbles. It’s a powerful, peak-time track that plays the long game rather than going for the easy payoff, and so is the more hypnotic “Undulate,” where 808 depth charges plunge through an aquamarine swirl of keys and drum hits. With “Encrypted,” Pugilist tries his hand at a new cadence, toying with the 160-BPM pulse of drum’n’bass while letting dub’s dragging anchor slow the tempo to a crawl. It sounds almost like a contemporary take on Seefeel’s doleful clang.
A little-known fact about Whities Blue is that the label began as a response to Brexit. When the British pound dropped precipitously in the face of uncertainty as to how, exactly, the UK was going to extricate itself from the EU, the price of manufacturing and shipping records shot up—especially for a label like Whities, with its lavishly printed full-color record covers. Sporting generic sleeves, the Whities Blue series—the name is a subtle reference to the European Union’s flag—became a means of putting out records more cheaply and quickly. There’s no solution to Brexit in sight, but on these two releases, Whities Blue maintains its resolutely international perspective, drawing together sounds from the U.S., Germany, Latin America, and the Caribbean into a cosmopolitan web of influence and exchange. Like the best dance music, it makes an airtight case that we’re stronger together than alone.
